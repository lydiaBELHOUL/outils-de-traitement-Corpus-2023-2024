1962) is an american former world no. 1 tennis player. she won three major titles, the women's singles titles at the 1979 and 1981 us opens, and the mixed doubles title at the 1980 wimbledon championships. additionally, she won the wta tour championships in 1980 and the year-ending toyota championships in 1981, both in singles. tracy ann austin holt (born december 12, 1962) is an american former world no. 1 tennis player. she won three major titles, the women's singles titles at the 1979 and 1981 us opens, and the mixed doubles title at the 1980 wimbledon championships. additionally, she won the wta tour championships in 1980 and the year-ending toyota championships in 1981, both in singles. tracy austin was born december 12, 1962, in palos verdes peninsula, california. her parents were george and jeanne austin. in january 1977, a month after turning fourteen, austin won her first professional singles title, defeating stacy margolin at the avon futures event in portland. as an amateur she could not accept the prize money. at her wimbledon debut in 1977 she reached the third round where she lost to top-seeded chris evert. in september, she made her us open debut and reached the quarterfinal, falling to fifth-seeded betty stöve. austin followed up with tournament wins in tokyo and washington, defeating martina navratilova in both finals. she defeated 35-year-old billie jean king in the quarterfinals of the 1979 wimbledon championships, then lost to eventual champion navratilova in straight sets in the semifinals. in september, austin became the youngest-ever us open champion, aged 16 years and 9 months, by defeating second-seeded navratilova in the semifinals and top seed chris evert in the final. evert had been attempting to win the title for the fifth consecutive year. earlier that year, austin ended evert's 125-match winning streak on clay by beating her in three sets in a semifinal of the italian open. austin lost in the semifinals of both grand slam tournaments she played in 1980. evonne goolagong cawley, seeded fourth and the eventual champion, defeated austin at the wimbledon championships. as the top seed and defending champion at the us open, austin was expected to extend her five-match winning streak against third-ranked evert. austin took a 4–0 lead in the first set before evert won 16 of the final 20 games to win the match. evert went on to defeat hana mandlíková in the final. austin was ranked the world no. 1 singles player in 1980 for two weeks (april 7–20) and then for 19 weeks (july 7-november 17), partly because she captured the two tour-ending events. austin defeated navratilova to win the avon championships in march and andrea jaeger to capture the 1980 colgate series championships in january 1981. in 1980, austin won the wimbledon mixed doubles title with her brother john, becoming the first brother and sister team to win a grand slam title together. during the first four months of 1981, austin played only two events because of chronic injuries. on grass, she defended her singles title at the eastbourne international in the united kingdom in june without losing a set. after wimbledon, austin won 26 consecutive matches and four consecutive tournaments. she defeated pam shriver in the final of the wells fargo open in san diego, and three weeks later, she beat both navratilova and evert in straight sets to win the canadian open in toronto. as the third-seeded player at the us open, austin defeated fourth-seeded navratilova in a three-set final. navratilova, however, ended austin's winning streak in the final of the u.s. indoor championships. in europe during the autumn, austin lost to sue barker in the quarterfinals of the brighton international in brighton, united kingdom, but recovered the following week to defeat navratilova in the final of the porsche tennis grand prix in stuttgart, west germany. at the final grand slam tournament of the year, austin was seeded second but lost to sixth-seeded shriver in the australian open quarterfinals. the 1981 year-ending toyota series championships featured two matches against evert and one against navratilova. evert won her round-robin match with austin, then austin defeated evert in their semifinal. austin won the tournament with a three-set defeat of navratilova. the associated press named austin its 1981 female athlete of the year for the second time. back injuries and recurring sciatica then began to impair austin's effectiveness and sidelined her for long stretches. billie jean king, seeded twelfth, upset third-seeded austin in the 1982 wimbledon quarterfinals. several weeks later, however, austin won her 30th and final top-level singles title in san diego. austin had a good showing at the 1982 season-ending toyota series championships where she defeated jaeger, the world no. 3, in straight sets to reach the semifinals. however, she was unable to repeat 1981's victory over evert, who defeated her in the semifinals. in 1992, austin became the youngest person to be inducted into the international tennis hall of fame, at the age of 29. she attempted a second comeback in 1993 and 1994 but was not particularly successful. in 1993, austin upset rennae stubbs and katerina maleeva at the evert cup in indian wells, california, then lost to stephanie rottier. at the wta manhattan beach event, she upset gigi fernández and elena likhovtseva, then lost to gabriela sabatini in the round of 16. her wins over maleeva, fernandez, and likhovtseva began a buzz that austin might become at least a top 20 player again. however, in 1994, her results were not as promising and at the evert cup in indian wells, california, austin lost in the second round to steffi graf, and austin soon retired in june 1994. since retiring as a player, austin has worked as a commentator for nbc and the usa network for the french open and the us open. during the 2000s, she worked for the seven network, which broadcast the australian open and usually participates in the bbc's wimbledon coverage. she began working for the tennis channel in 2010 and joined its us open team and later its australian open team in 2012. austin has worked for canadian television for its coverage of the rogers cup since 2004."

1990, in minneapolis, minnesota, to lon and barb hand of hampton, iowa. hand's family moved around minnesota during his childhood, with stops in west st. paul and eagan before settling in chaska just before hand entered high school. he was a three-sport varsity athlete at chaska high school, receiving honors in american football, ice hockey, and baseball. hand finished his senior baseball season with an 8–2 win–loss record, two saves, and a 0.61 earned run average (era), allowing only six earned runs in 68 innings pitched. this included a complete game, three-hit shutout against eden prairie high school, a 3–0 victory in which hand struck out 14 batters. at the plate, hand batted .352 with eight home runs and 24 runs batted in (rbi). in 2009, hand was promoted to the greensboro grasshoppers of the low-a south atlantic league, where he went 7–13 with a 4.86 era in 26 starts. his 13 losses set a franchise record in greensboro, but he also led the team that season with 122 strikeouts in 127+2⁄3 innings. he improved as the season went on in greensboro: hand was 2–5 with a 7.68 era in his first eight starts, but had only a 3.84 era in his next 19 appearances. he was promoted to the class a-advanced jupiter hammerheads to begin the 2010 season, and by mid-june, he led the team with a 4–3 record, 3.33 era, and 74 strikeouts in 75+2⁄3 innings. hand was named the florida state league pitcher of the week for the week ending june 13 after pitching a complete game shutout against the tampa yankees. he went 8–8 with a 3.33 era in 26 starts for jupiter before receiving a promotion to the double-a jacksonville suns at the beginning of september. in his only appearance for jacksonville that season, hand held the tennessee smokies to four hits in six innings of a 6–2 jacksonville win. hand returned to the suns to begin the 2011 baseball season, the only left-handed pitcher in both the starting rotation and bullpen. the marlins, who were in need of an additional starting pitcher when josh johnson was placed on the disabled list, promoted hand to florida on june 6, 2011. at the time, he was 7–1 with a 3.53 era in jacksonville. he made his mlb debut the next day, allowing only one earned run on one hit – a solo home run to álex gonzález in the fourth inning – in six innings against the atlanta braves, but took the loss as the marlins were shut out 1–0. his first major league win came on july 8, 2011, hand's fifth start, when he held the houston astros to two hits in five innings of a 5–0 shutout win. after the game, the marlins optioned hand, who had a 1–3 record and 2.77 era, back down to jacksonville so he could continue to pitch during the all-star game break. he received three more major league promotions between july and september, but was sent back down both times as he struggled both with controlling his pitches and with allowing home runs. johnson remained sidelined with a shoulder injury throughout that period, and in his absence, reliever clay hensley had become a starting pitcher. with the team out of playoff contention by september, however, manager jack mckeon sent hensley back to the bullpen and allowed hand to start the final stretch of games and sell himself as a major league player for the 2012 season. in his first season with the marlins, hand went 1–8 with a 4.20 era in 12 starts, and he recorded 38 strikeouts in 60 innings. he was 11–4 with a 3.40 era in 19 jacksonville games, meanwhile, all but one of which were starts, and struck out 71 batters in 108+2⁄3 innings. while hand made a change to the angle of his throwing arm during the 2011–12 offseason, which helped him throw more strikes in spring training, he did not make the miami marlins'[a] 2012 opening day roster, and was instead assigned to jacksonville on march 18. he instead started the minor league season with the triple-a new orleans zephyrs as part of a starting rotation that also included tom koehler, alex sanabia, wade leblanc, and j. d. martin. hand received his first mlb call-up of the season on august 3 to pitch in the second game of a doubleheader against the washington nationals. the mlb collective bargaining agreement allowed a player like hand to join a team as the 26th person on their 25-man roster for a same-day doubleheader as long as he was sent back to the minors the next day. at the time of his promotion, hand was 8–5 in new orleans, with a 3.66 era, 116 strikeouts, and 54 walks. he struggled in his lone start, allowing seven runs on six hits and six walks in 3+2⁄3 innings. hand was removed from the game after throwing 97 pitches in less than four innings, including a 33-pitch first inning, and the nationals won 7–2. hand made 27 starts with the zephyrs in 2012, going 11–7 with a 4.00 era in the process, and he struck out 141 batters in 148+1⁄3 innings while issuing 75 walks. shortly before the 2017 season, hand agreed to a one-year contract extension with

heart of the colorado rockies' lineup – charlie blackmon, nolan arenado, and david dahl – in the seventh inning of a game. on april 18, hand struck out all four giants batters he faced, becoming the first padres pitcher to strike out every batter he faced in a multi-inning save. after converting all 10 save opportunities he faced, mlb named hand the nl pitcher of the month for may. hand's pitching appeared to improve with its frequency: by mid-june, he had a 1.23 era working on two or fewer days of rest between appearances, compared to a 7.11 era with three or more days of rest. while he struggled in june and july, with three blown saves boosting his era from 2.30 to 3.05, hand pitched another perfect inning in his second all-star game, retiring all three batters he faced in the eighth inning. making 41 appearances for the padres in 2018, hand went 2–4 with a 3.05 era, converting 24 of 29 save opportunities while striking out 65 batters in 44+1⁄3 innings. on july 19, 2018, the padres traded hand and adam cimber to the cleveland indians, who were poised to lose several relievers to free agency during the 2018–19 offseason, in exchange for catching prospect francisco mejia. on his new team, hand became a setup man for cleveland closer cody allen, who had 19 saves on the season but had blown several attempts, including a game that trevor bauer left 4–0 against the cincinnati reds that ended in a 7–4 loss for the indians. by late august, while allen remained the de facto closer for the indians, hand, who allowed only two earned runs in 14 appearances, was receiving save opportunities. after being traded, hand made 28 appearances for cleveland, finishing 11 games, and he went 0–1 with a 2.28 era while converting eight of 10 save opportunities. the indians, meanwhile, were the al central division champions, giving hand his first playoff appearance in the 2018 american league division series against the houston astros. the astros swept the indians in the best-of-five series, with hand allowing correa's first hit of the series, a three-run home run in game 3. prior to spring training, indians manager terry francona announced that hand would be the team's closer for the 2019 season. he was 22-for-22 in save opportunities until june 25, when hunter dozier hit a grand slam against hand in the ninth inning of the indians' game against the royals, giving kansas city a three-run lead. hand's era jumped from 1.05 to 2.36 after the outing, and the indians lost 8–6. he received his third consecutive all-star game selection in 2019 after striking out 52 batters in 27 appearances. hand was far less successful in the second half of the season, which he attributed to a mechanical issue with his slider delivery. after his first blown save, he had a 6.95 era, a .347 batting average against, and five more blown saves in 22 innings. following a stretch of 19 games in which hand allowed 12 earned runs on 26 hits for a 6.00 era, the indians sent their pitcher back to cleveland in the middle of a road trip to undergo medical imaging. he was sidelined between september 9 and 20 with what was described as a ""tired arm"", after which he made only one more appearance to finish out the season. in 60 appearances for cleveland, hand went 6–4 with a 3.30 era and converted 34 of 39 save opportunities while striking out 84 batters in 57+1⁄3 innings. the washington nationals, who had lost their only left-handed reliever after sean doolittle became a free agent that offseason, signed hand to a one-year, $10.5 million contract on january 26, 2021. serving once again as his team's closer, hand blew his first regular-season save since 2019 on may 8 against the yankees. he first took the game into extra innings by allowing dj lemahieu to tie in the ninth inning. trea turner put the nationals up 3–2 in the top of the 10th inning, but hand allowed a mike ford rbi to tie the game again, and tanner rainey lost the game 4–3 when he allowed gleyber torres to walk off in the 11th. after more difficult outings raised hand's may era to 7.56, he made a fastball adjustment that was followed by two clean saves in a row. he was more successful from may 22 to july 20, with a 1.52 era in 22 appearances during that stretch, but ended his tenure in washington with seven runs allowed in 2+2⁄3 innings in his last three appearances. limited by his difficulties in finding the strike zone, hand was 5–5 with a 3.59 era in 41 appearances for the nationals, and he converted 21 of 26 save opportunities. on march 16, 2022, the philadelphia phillies signed hand to a one-year, $6 million contract. interim manager rob thomson did not assign relief pitchers to specific innings, and hand was instead utilized in late innings when the phillies were set to face a string of left-handed batters. he saw increased usage in august when corey knebel and seranthony domínguez were both sideliend with injuries, before landing on the injured list with left elbow tendinitis at the end of september. hand appeared in 55 regular-season games for the phillies, going 3–2 with a 2.80 era and five saves in 45 innings. the phillies advanced to the postseason for the first time since 2011, with hand making seven appearances in the postseason. this included two shutout innings against the houston astros during the 2022 world series, which philadelphia lost in six games."

""pitbull"" completed a busy 2006, during which he fought four times. at ufc 66, he dominated tony desouza, knocking out the jiu-jitsu black belt with a knee in the second round. following his victory, it was announced that alves tested positive for a diuretic, spironolactone, which he supposedly used to help him lose water weight in order to make the 170-pound limit. as a result of the failed drug test, alves was suspended eight months by the nevada state athletic commission and fined $5,500. in his first bout of 2008 at ufc fight night 13, alves faced his biggest test to date, as he was matched up against welterweight contender karo parisyan. after resisting any attempts to grapple but failing to amount any significant offense during the stand-up exchanges throughout the first round, ""the pitbull"" scored a knee to the head of parisyan, knocking down the judo expert before finishing him on the ground with strikes. once again taking just two months between bouts, alves accepted a fight against former ufc welterweight champion matt hughes, a fighter widely considered the most dominant champion in ufc history. the welterweight bout, which served as the main event of ufc 85 in london, was scheduled as a late replacement after chuck liddell had to pull out of his headliner fight against rashad evans with a hamstring injury. prior to the bout, alves surprised many by missing weight for the welterweight bout—coming in at 174 pounds. despite his opponent missing the 170-pound limit, hughes accepted the fight at a catchweight. despite the pre-fight blunder, alves shocked the crowd by dominating the heavily favored former champion. after picking apart hughes standing and displaying vastly-improved takedown defense throughout the first round, ""the pitbull"" knocked hughes down with a flying knee and followed him to the ground with punches early in the second, earning a tko stoppage. this win earned alves his first knockout of the night bonus award. in the post fight interview, alves attributed not making weight to spraining his ankle two weeks before the fight. josh koscheck, another top-contender and four-time ncaa wrestling all-american, stepped in for sanchez on short notice. alves controlled most of the fight and won via unanimous decision (30–27, 29–28, and 30–27). the brazilian's improved takedown-defense was once again on display, as the american top team fighter forced koscheck into a kick boxing battle. alves' devastating leg kicks proved to be a factor throughout the bout, taking away much of koscheck's mobility. he also managed to drop koscheck several times during the 3-round bout, but koscheck's quick recovery enabled him to survive the onslaughts. with his impressive victory over koscheck, alves was on a 7-fight win streak, winning 9 of his past 10 bouts. after consecutive dominant performances against parisyan, hughes and koscheck, dana white announced that alves had earned a title shot against the winner of the welterweight title-fight at ufc 94. after georges st-pierre defended his title at ufc 94, alves entered the ring to congratulate him. st. pierre said that he was looking forward to facing alves in the cage. thiago alves fought georges st-pierre for the welterweight title at the mandalay bay in las vegas on 11 july 2009 at ufc 100. during the fight, alves was taken down a total of ten times.

not be taking the fight due to a contract dispute with the promotion. alves was rescheduled to face jim miller at the event. at the weigh-ins, alves missed weight by nearly seven pounds, weighing in at 162.6 lbs. miller, who was already on weight, had to rehydrate to keep their weight difference within 7 pounds. because of that, he came in at 157.6 lbs and the bout proceeded at catchweight. new york state athletic commission and ufc officials indicated that alves must not weigh more than 173 lbs the day of the fight or the fight would be cancelled. as a result, alves was fined 20% of his fight purse, which went to miller. he lost the fight by unanimous decision. after the failed attempt at lightweight, alves returned to welterweight and faced patrick côté on 8 april 2017 at ufc 210.

ultimate fighter, julian lane, at bkfc 12 in daytona beach, fl on 11 september 2020 alves won the fight by split decision. alves then faced ulysses diaz for the inaugural middleweight championship at bkfc 18 on 26 june 2021. he claimed the championship via technical knockout after the ringside doctor stopped the bout after the third round. his contract with bkfc expired on 12 may 2022, so he was stripped of the bkfc middleweight championship. aside from his mixed martial arts athlete and coach careers, alves was in the process of becoming a police officer in florida. however, there are no plans to become a police officer as he will focus on his coaching at american top team and being a director for an online training platform called life training."

""this is not a mere change of guard, it is a fundamental change,"" said museveni, after a ceremony conducted by british-born chief justice peter allen. speaking to crowds of thousands outside the ugandan parliament, museveni promised a return to democracy: ""the people of africa, the people of uganda, are entitled to a democratic government. it is not a favour from any regime. the sovereign people must be the public, not the government."" in 1997 he introduced free primary education. in august 1998, rwanda and uganda invaded the drc again during the second congo war, this time to overthrow kabila, who was a former ally of museveni and kagame. museveni and a few close military advisers alone made the decision to send the uganda people's defence force (updf) into the drc. a number of highly placed sources indicate that the ugandan parliament and civilian advisers were not consulted over the matter, as is required by the 1995 constitution.: 262–263 museveni apparently persuaded an initially reluctant high command to go along with the venture. ""we felt that the rwandese started the war and it was their duty to go ahead and finish the job, but our president took time and convinced us that we had a stake in what is going on in congo"", one senior officer is reported as saying. a confidential world bank report leaked in may suggested that the international lender might cut its support to non-humanitarian programmes in uganda. ""we regret that we cannot be more positive about the present political situation in uganda, especially given the country's admirable record through the late 1990s"", said the paper. ""the government has largely failed to integrate the country's diverse peoples into a single political process that is viable over the long term... perhaps most significant, the political trend-lines, as a result of the president's apparent determination to press for a third term, point downward."" he is married to janet kataaha museveni, née kainembabazi, with whom he has four children:"

of corporal in the idf's armor corps at the time of his capture, and he was subsequently promoted to sergeant, staff sergeant, and sergeant first class just before his release. he holds dual israeli and french citizenship, the latter via his grandmother. shalit was born on 28 august 1986 in nahariya, israel, to noam and aviva shalit. he has an older brother and a younger sister. he was raised from in mitzpe hila in the western galilee. he graduated with distinction from manor kabri high school. shalit began military service in the israel defense forces in july 2005, and ""despite a low

gaza in august 2009. israeli forces entered khan yunis on 28 june 2006 to restore quiet after repeated rocket attacks. freeing shalit was not one of the objectives of the mission called ""summer rains"". according to an israeli embassy spokesperson, ""israel did everything it could in exhausting all diplomatic options and gave mahmoud abbas the opportunity to return the abducted israeli… this operation can be terminated immediately, conditioned on the release of gilad shalit."" on the same day, four israeli air force aircraft flew over syrian president bashar al-assad's palace in latakia, because israel views the syrian leadership as a sponsor of hamas, according to an idf spokesperson. the operation did not succeed in finding shalit. he also said: ""we have managed to keep the soldier in captivity for six months and we have no problem keeping him for years."" on 17 january 2007, one of the captor groups, the army of islam headed by mumtaz dormush, claimed that shalit was being held exclusively by hamas. on 8 march 2007, jerusalem post reported that an agreement had been reached with hamas over the number of prisoners israel would release in return for shalit. israel and hamas were still negotiating specific prisoners who hamas wanted freed in return for shalit. on 7 april 2007, it was reported that shalit's captors had transferred to israel, through egyptian mediators, a list of palestinian prisoners they wanted freed. the list included names of approximately 1,300 prisoners, some of whom were high-ranking fatah members.[citation needed] shalit's father, noam, met with former united states president jimmy carter during carter's april 2008 visit to israel. carter planned to visit hamas leader khaled mashal in damascus later. noam shalit said that the fact that carter was not considered pro-israel could be beneficial in securing his son's release. on 9 june 2008, it was reported that hamas sent shalit's family a third letter. the group had promised to send them a third letter after mediation from carter. the handwriting was confirmed to be shalit's. on 20 august 2008, in his briefing to the united nations security council, the under-secretary-general of the un appeared to link the decision to release 200 palestinian prisoners to the case, though a hamas spokesman saw it as an attempt to increase palestinian internal divisions by releasing only those loyal to the fatah faction. president peres publicly thanked turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdoğan for showing compassion to shalit. on 18 october 2011, shalit was transferred to israel. the idf transferred him, via helicopter, to the base in tel-nof, where he was reunited with his parents and met the prime minister benjamin netanyahu. in the base he went through medical tests; it was found that he was malnourished and suffered from vitamin deficiencies. after the tests were completed, he was then transferred by helicopter to his home, where many who supported his release waited outside his house to see his return. shalit subsequently began to rehabilitate with idf assistance. in july 2009, noam shalit, gilad's father, testified before the goldstone committee, which was investigating on behalf of the united nations illegal conduct by combatants during gaza war. shalit told the committee that his son has lived without human rights for three years, and that no one, including the red cross, knows what happened to him or has paid him a visit. the jerusalem post reported that it obtained photographs showing children at the graduation ceremony of a hamas-run summer camp, reenacting shalit's abduction. the photos were reported to show osama mazini, a senior hamas political official in charge of the shalit negotiations with israel, attending the play. in 2010, at least two cathedrals in switzerland turned off their lights for several minutes in solidarity with shalit. on the fourth anniversary of shalit's abduction, the lights of the colosseum were turned off. and so were the lights around the old city walls in jerusalem. a flotilla of ships, called the true freedom flotilla, sailed around the statue of liberty and past the united nations. shalit stated that he had some good things such as television, radio, food, and opportunities to play checkers and dominos with the guards. he stated that they ""did not abuse [him] too much"". shalit stated that he kept a regular schedule such as getting up and going to bed at the same time every day, learned some arabic, and chatted with his captors about sports. in june 2011, the zionist federation, among other organizations, stepped up a campaign to ensure that shalit and his abduction are not forgotten, encouraging members and sympathizers to contact their local mp, mep and to write letters to newspapers and to shalit's family with words of support. this followed a two-week gilad shalit awareness campaign in february, organized by the embassy of israel alongside ten other community organizations. the israeli defense ministry, in anticipation of his release, determined that shalit would be accorded the status of a disabled veteran with a minimum of 20% disability immediately following his liberation from captivity. at the time of his abduction, shalit held the rank of corporal, but he was promoted to sergeant during his captivity. upon his release, shalit returned to his parents' residence in mitzpe hila, an event that garnered substantial attention both within israel and internationally, resulting in the presence of numerous media outlets and ordinary citizens in mitzpe hila. in an act of consideration for shalit's privacy, many israeli media organizations committed to limiting extensive coverage of his return. in january 2012, noam shalit, gilad's father, declared his intention to participate as a candidate in the israeli labor party's primaries for the knesset. on april 18, 2012, gilad shalit was honorably discharged from the idf with the rank of sergeant major. in june 2012, shalit, known for his enthusiasm for sports and his support for maccabi tel aviv b.c., secured employment as a sports reporter for yedioth ahronoth, where he contributed a regular column covering israeli and european basketball. his inaugural assignment took him to the united states to report on the 2012 nba finals in oklahoma city."

collaros took his first snap as college quarterback halfway through the fourth quarter. on the season, he had one completion on four attempts for a total of two yards. he also rushed six times for a total of 29 yards. collaros signed with the tampa bay buccaneers after going undrafted in the 2012 nfl draft but did not make the team. collaros signed a contract to play for the toronto argonauts of the canadian football league in june 2012. he played in one game during the 2012 cfl season, completing seven of 11 passes for 101 yards and one touchdown. in the first preseason game of the 2013 cfl season he completed nine of 12 passes for 95 yards and one touchdown. on july 30, he had his first cfl start in place of the injured ricky ray, as the argonauts defeated the b.c. lions at the rogers centre. he threw for three touchdowns and completed 21 of 25 passes for 253 yards. collaros had an outstanding 2013 season. he played in 14 games that season and was the starting quarterback for eight

understanding that collaros would not re-sign with the argos and would instead test the free-agent market, argos general manager jim barker decided to release collaros prior to the start of free agency. after failing to come to terms on a new contract, the argonauts released collaros on january 29, 2014. collaros signed a contract to play for the toronto argonauts of the canadian football

likely miss the start of the 2016 regular season as he recovers from his torn acl injury. on june 19, three days before the season commenced, austin confirmed that collaros would not be starting the season as he continued to rehab his knee. prior to week 8, and almost 11 months since sustaining his knee injury, collaros returned to practising with the first team offense. collaros made his season debut in time for the team's week 8 match against the bc lions. the following season, on august 29, 2017, after an 0–8 start to the 2017 season, tiger-cats head coach june jones announced that jeremiah masoli would get the start at quarterback in week 11 over collaros. collaros did not start another game for the tiger-cats in the 2017 season. by all accounts, 2017 was the worst season of collaros' career. not only did he not win a game, he also posted a career low quarterback efficiency rating of 88.1 and career low completion percentage (62.8%). his touchdown-to-interception ratio (8:7) was also the lowest of his career. on january 3, 2018, collaros was traded to the saskatchewan roughriders for a 2nd round pick in the 2018 cfl draft. on january 19, 2018, collaros agreed to a restructured contract with the riders. prior to the restructured deal collaros was set to make $500,000 in 2018, plus a $200,000 roster bonus due february 1, 2018. collaros suffered a concussion in the team's week 2 loss to the ottawa redblacks. in the following week collaros was placed on the six-game injured reserve. collaros played in 14 regular season games during the 2018 regular season, leading the riders to a 12-6 record and a home playoff game. collaros was unable to play in the western semi-final playoff game because of a concussion, and the riders were defeated by the blue bombers 23-18, ending their season. collaros re-signed with the riders on the opening day of free agency, february 12, 2019, for a one-year contract. collaros was knocked out of the first game of the season when he was hit in the head by ti-cats linebacker simoni lawrence while attempting to slide. collaros was subsequently placed on the 6-game injured list. on july 31, 2019, collaros was traded to the toronto argonauts in exchange for a conditional fourth round pick in the 2020 cfl draft. the pick could have been upgraded to as high as a second-round pick in that draft if collaros had met playing time targets and extension clauses. in early september 2019, collaros was still unable to participate in practice because of the concussion he suffered in week 1. however, by the end of the month he was throwing the ball in practice. collaros was traded to the winnipeg blue bombers, on the cfl's 2019 trade deadline day, october 9, 2019, along with an exchange of draft picks in the 2020 cfl draft. the bombers had lost starting quarterback matt nichols to a season ending injury earlier in the season and the bombers had lost four of their last five games with chris streveler under centre. prior to the last game of the regular season, collaros started taking first-team reps in practice for the bombers, and was announced as the starting quarterback on october 24, 2019, taking over for an injured streveler. collaros threw his first passes of the year to count (his lone attempt for the roughriders was wiped out due to a defensive penalty) and lead the blue bombers to a victory in their season finale. collaros formed a qb tandem with streveler, where streveler served primarily as a gritty run option. the two turned what had been a late season slump for the bombers, into a post-season winning streak that saw winnipeg defeat the hamilton tiger-cats 33-12 to win the 107th grey cup. collaros' grey cup victory was unique in that he beat saskatchewan, the team he started the season with in the division finals and then beat hamilton, whose linebacker simoni lawrence had hit him in the head in week 1 and knocking him out for a significant portion of the season, on his way to the championship. the media had frequently brought these circumstances up and collaros did not answer them until the final media session after the grey cup saying ""what are they calling it? the revenge tour? we finished it. it’s over. last show tonight."" on january 27, 2020, collaros and the bombers agreed to a two-year contract extension, preventing him from becoming a free agent on february 11. collaros and his wife, nicole, own a home in aurora, ontario. the couple were acquainted through former hamilton tiger-cats player andy fantuz and his wife amanda, and they were married in february 2019. he is of greek heritage, and is an avid and enthusiastic greek dancer. collaros was a roommate of future nfl players travis kelce and jason kelce in college, and remains good friends with both brothers."

statistics in the entire english football pyramid, and were promoted to the premier league with a record 106 points. in january 2007, downes was involved in a touchline scuffle with sheffield united manager neil warnock after he accused warnock of telling his players to 'break legs'. however warnock said: ""i made the kicking gesture to tell the referee that steve sidwell's tackle on chris armstrong had been the worst of the game. fortunately for me, the referee heard exactly what was said and confirmed that."" downes was charged with improper conduct for his role in the affray. on 14 may 2009, the club announced that they wouldn't renew his and kevin dillon's contract after reading failed to bounce back to the premier league at the first attempt after getting knocked out of the
