Tracy Ann Austin Holt (born December 12, 1962) is an American former world No. 1 tennis player. She won three major titles, the women's singles titles at the 1979 and 1981 US Opens, and the mixed doubles title at the 1980 Wimbledon Championships. Additionally, she won the WTA Tour Championships in 1980 and the year-ending Toyota Championships in 1981, both in singles.
Tracy Austin was born December 12, 1962, in Palos Verdes Peninsula, California.[6] Her parents were George and Jeanne Austin.[7]
In January 1977, a month after turning fourteen, Austin won her first professional singles title, defeating Stacy Margolin at the Avon Futures event in Portland.[8][9] As an amateur she could not accept the prize money.[10][8] At her Wimbledon debut in 1977 she reached the third round where she lost to top-seeded Chris Evert. In September, she made her US Open debut and reached the quarterfinal, falling to fifth-seeded Betty Stöve.[11]
Austin followed up with tournament wins in Tokyo and Washington, defeating Martina Navratilova in both finals.[15] She defeated 35-year-old Billie Jean King in the quarterfinals of the 1979 Wimbledon Championships, then lost to eventual champion Navratilova in straight sets in the semifinals. In September, Austin became the youngest-ever US Open champion, aged 16 years and 9 months, by defeating second-seeded Navratilova in the semifinals and top seed Chris Evert in the final.[16][11] Evert had been attempting to win the title for the fifth consecutive year.[11] Earlier that year, Austin ended Evert's 125-match winning streak on clay by beating her in three sets in a semifinal of the Italian Open.[17][16]
Austin lost in the semifinals of both Grand Slam tournaments she played in 1980. Evonne Goolagong Cawley, seeded fourth and the eventual champion, defeated Austin at the Wimbledon Championships. As the top seed and defending champion at the US Open, Austin was expected to extend her five-match winning streak against third-ranked Evert. Austin took a 4–0 lead in the first set before Evert won 16 of the final 20 games to win the match. Evert went on to defeat Hana Mandlíková in the final. Austin was ranked the world No. 1 singles player in 1980 for two weeks (April 7–20) and then for 19 weeks (July 7-November 17), partly because she captured the two tour-ending events. Austin defeated Navratilova to win the Avon Championships in March and Andrea Jaeger to capture the 1980 Colgate Series Championships in January 1981. In 1980, Austin won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title with her brother John, becoming the first brother and sister team to win a Grand Slam title together.[1]
During the first four months of 1981, Austin played only two events because of chronic injuries. On grass, she defended her singles title at the Eastbourne International in the United Kingdom in June without losing a set. After Wimbledon, Austin won 26 consecutive matches and four consecutive tournaments.[16] She defeated Pam Shriver in the final of the Wells Fargo Open in San Diego, and three weeks later, she beat both Navratilova and Evert in straight sets to win the Canadian Open in Toronto. As the third-seeded player at the US Open, Austin defeated fourth-seeded Navratilova in a three-set final. Navratilova, however, ended Austin's winning streak in the final of the U.S. Indoor Championships. In Europe during the autumn, Austin lost to Sue Barker in the quarterfinals of the Brighton International in Brighton, United Kingdom, but recovered the following week to defeat Navratilova in the final of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, West Germany. At the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, Austin was seeded second but lost to sixth-seeded Shriver in the Australian Open quarterfinals. The 1981 year-ending Toyota Series Championships featured two matches against Evert and one against Navratilova. Evert won her round-robin match with Austin, then Austin defeated Evert in their semifinal. Austin won the tournament with a three-set defeat of Navratilova.[19] The Associated Press named Austin its 1981 Female Athlete of the Year for the second time.[20]
Back injuries and recurring sciatica then began to impair Austin's effectiveness and sidelined her for long stretches. Billie Jean King, seeded twelfth, upset third-seeded Austin in the 1982 Wimbledon quarterfinals. Several weeks later, however, Austin won her 30th and final top-level singles title in San Diego. Austin had a good showing at the 1982 season-ending Toyota Series Championships where she defeated Jaeger, the world No. 3, in straight sets to reach the semifinals. However, she was unable to repeat 1981's victory over Evert, who defeated her in the semifinals.
In 1992, Austin became the youngest person to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, at the age of 29.[1] She attempted a second comeback in 1993 and 1994 but was not particularly successful. In 1993, Austin upset Rennae Stubbs and Katerina Maleeva at the Evert Cup in Indian Wells, California, then lost to Stephanie Rottier. At the WTA Manhattan Beach event, she upset Gigi Fernández and Elena Likhovtseva, then lost to Gabriela Sabatini in the round of 16.  Her wins over Maleeva, Fernandez, and Likhovtseva began a buzz that Austin might become at least a top 20 player again. However, in 1994, her results were not as promising and at the Evert Cup in Indian Wells, California, Austin lost in the second round to Steffi Graf, and Austin soon retired in June 1994.[23]
Since retiring as a player, Austin has worked as a commentator for NBC and the USA Network for the French Open and the US Open. During the 2000s, she worked for the Seven Network, which broadcast the Australian Open and usually participates in the BBC's Wimbledon coverage. She began working for the Tennis Channel in 2010 and joined its US Open team and later its Australian Open team in 2012. Austin has worked for Canadian television for its coverage of the Rogers Cup since 2004."

Hand's family moved around Minnesota during his childhood, with stops in West St. Paul and Eagan before settling in Chaska just before Hand entered high school.[2] He was a three-sport varsity athlete at Chaska High School, receiving honors in American football, ice hockey, and baseball.[3] Hand finished his senior baseball season with an 8–2 win–loss record, two saves, and a 0.61 earned run average (ERA), allowing only six earned runs in 68 innings pitched. This included a complete game, three-hit shutout against Eden Prairie High School, a 3–0 victory in which Hand struck out 14 batters. At the plate, Hand batted .352 with eight home runs and 24 runs batted in (RBI).[4]
In 2009, Hand was promoted to the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the Low-A South Atlantic League, where he went 7–13 with a 4.86 ERA in 26 starts.[8] His 13 losses set a franchise record in Greensboro,[11] but he also led the team that season with 122 strikeouts in 127+2⁄3 innings.[12] He improved as the season went on in Greensboro: Hand was 2–5 with a 7.68 ERA in his first eight starts, but had only a 3.84 ERA in his next 19 appearances.[5] He was promoted to the Class A-Advanced Jupiter Hammerheads to begin the 2010 season,[13] and by mid-June, he led the team with a 4–3 record, 3.33 ERA, and 74 strikeouts in 75+2⁄3 innings.[14] Hand was named the Florida State League Pitcher of the Week for the week ending June 13 after pitching a complete game shutout against the Tampa Yankees.[12] He went 8–8 with a 3.33 ERA in 26 starts for Jupiter before receiving a promotion to the Double-A Jacksonville Suns at the beginning of September.[15] In his only appearance for Jacksonville that season,[8] Hand held the Tennessee Smokies to four hits in six innings of a 6–2 Jacksonville win.[15]
Hand returned to the Suns to begin the 2011 baseball season, the only left-handed pitcher in both the starting rotation and bullpen.[16] The Marlins, who were in need of an additional starting pitcher when Josh Johnson was placed on the disabled list, promoted Hand to Florida on June 6, 2011. At the time, he was 7–1 with a 3.53 ERA in Jacksonville.[17] He made his MLB debut the next day, allowing only one earned run on one hit – a solo home run to Álex González in the fourth inning –  in six innings against the Atlanta Braves, but took the loss as the Marlins were shut out 1–0.[18] His first major league win came on July 8, 2011, Hand's fifth start, when he held the Houston Astros to two hits in five innings of a 5–0 shutout win. After the game, the Marlins optioned Hand, who had a 1–3 record and 2.77 ERA, back down to Jacksonville so he could continue to pitch during the All-Star Game break.[19] He received three more major league promotions between July and September, but was sent back down both times as he struggled both with controlling his pitches and with allowing home runs.[20] Johnson remained sidelined with a shoulder injury throughout that period, and in his absence, reliever Clay Hensley had become a starting pitcher. With the team out of playoff contention by September, however, manager Jack McKeon sent Hensley back to the bullpen and allowed Hand to start the final stretch of games and sell himself as a major league player for the 2012 season.[21][22] In his first season with the Marlins, Hand went 1–8 with a 4.20 ERA in 12 starts, and he recorded 38 strikeouts in 60 innings.[23] He was 11–4 with a 3.40 ERA in 19 Jacksonville games, meanwhile, all but one of which were starts, and struck out 71 batters in 108+2⁄3 innings.[8]
While Hand made a change to the angle of his throwing arm during the 2011–12 offseason, which helped him throw more strikes in spring training, he did not make the Miami Marlins'[a] 2012 Opening Day roster, and was instead assigned to Jacksonville on March 18.[25] He instead started the minor league season with the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs as part of a starting rotation that also included Tom Koehler, Alex Sanabia, Wade LeBlanc, and J. D. Martin.[26] Hand received his first MLB call-up of the season on August 3 to pitch in the second game of a doubleheader against the Washington Nationals. The MLB collective bargaining agreement allowed a player like Hand to join a team as the 26th person on their 25-man roster for a same-day doubleheader as long as he was sent back to the minors the next day.[27] At the time of his promotion, Hand was 8–5 in New Orleans, with a 3.66 ERA, 116 strikeouts, and 54 walks.[28] He struggled in his lone start, allowing seven runs on six hits and six walks in 3+2⁄3 innings. Hand was removed from the game after throwing 97 pitches in less than four innings, including a 33-pitch first inning, and the Nationals won 7–2.[29] Hand made 27 starts with the Zephyrs in 2012, going 11–7 with a 4.00 ERA in the process, and he struck out 141 batters in 148+1⁄3 innings while issuing 75 walks.[8]
Shortly before the 2017 season, Hand agreed to a one-year contract extension with the Padres.[59] Equipped with a new slider, Hand had a strong start to the 2017 season, making it through his first six appearances without allowing a run.[60] By the end of June, he had a 2.59 ERA and was recording 11 strikeouts per nine innings (K/9), while opponents were batting only .120 against his slider.[61] After posting a 2.42 ERA and a 0.94 walks plus hits per innings pitched (WHIP) through 40 appearances, Hand received his first MLB All-Star Game selection in 2017.[62] There, he pitched a perfect seventh inning for the National League (NL) team, who ultimately lost 2–1 in extra innings.[63] Shortly afterwards, Hand was named the NL Reliever of the Month for July 2017, having maintained a 19+1⁄3-inning scoreless streak and 0.88 WHIP that month.[64] Primarily a setup man, Hand received his first save opportunity of the season on May 24, when he exchanged places with struggling closer Brandon Maurer. Hand came into the game in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and escaped the outing with two strikeouts and a flyout, helping the Padres defeat the Mets 6–5.[65] The Padres traded Maurer to the Kansas City Royals shortly before the trading deadline, at which point Hand took over the ninth-inning role for San Diego.[66] Hand finished a career-best year with a 2.16 ERA, 5.20 strikeout-to-walk ratio, 11.8 K/9, and 0.933 WHIP. He also made 21 saves, most of which came after the Maurer trade.[67]
Shortly before the 2017 season, Hand agreed to a one-year contract extension with the Padres.[59] Equipped with a new slider, Hand had a strong start to the 2017 season, making it through his first six appearances without allowing a run.[60] By the end of June, he had a 2.59 ERA and was recording 11 strikeouts per nine innings (K/9), while opponents were batting only .120 against his slider.[61] After posting a 2.42 ERA and a 0.94 walks plus hits per innings pitched (WHIP) through 40 appearances, Hand received his first MLB All-Star Game selection in 2017.[62] There, he pitched a perfect seventh inning for the National League (NL) team, who ultimately lost 2–1 in extra innings.[63] Shortly afterwards, Hand was named the NL Reliever of the Month for July 2017, having maintained a 19+1⁄3-inning scoreless streak and 0.88 WHIP that month.[64] Primarily a setup man, Hand received his first save opportunity of the season on May 24, when he exchanged places with struggling closer Brandon Maurer. Hand came into the game in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and escaped the outing with two strikeouts and a flyout, helping the Padres defeat the Mets 6–5.[65] The Padres traded Maurer to the Kansas City Royals shortly before the trading deadline, at which point Hand took over the ninth-inning role for San Diego.[66] Hand finished a career-best year with a 2.16 ERA, 5.20 strikeout-to-walk ratio, 11.8 K/9, and 0.933 WHIP. He also made 21 saves, most of which came after the Maurer trade.[67]
On January 14, 2018, the Padres signed Hand to a three-year, $19.75 million contract extension that also included an option for the 2021 season.[68] He was officially named as the team's 2018 closer during spring training, but he also made appearances in other high-leverage situations, such as when the Padres faced the heart of the Colorado Rockies' lineup – Charlie Blackmon, Nolan Arenado, and David Dahl – in the seventh inning of a game.[69] On April 18, Hand struck out all four Giants batters he faced, becoming the first Padres pitcher to strike out every batter he faced in a multi-inning save.[70] After converting all 10 save opportunities he faced, MLB named Hand the NL Pitcher of the Month for May.[71] Hand's pitching appeared to improve with its frequency: by mid-June, he had a 1.23 ERA working on two or fewer days of rest between appearances, compared to a 7.11 ERA with three or more days of rest.[72] While he struggled in June and July, with three blown saves boosting his ERA from 2.30 to 3.05, Hand pitched another perfect inning in his second All-Star Game, retiring all three batters he faced in the eighth inning.[73] Making 41 appearances for the Padres in 2018, Hand went 2–4 with a 3.05 ERA, converting 24 of 29 save opportunities while striking out 65 batters in 44+1⁄3 innings.[23]
On July 19, 2018, the Padres traded Hand and Adam Cimber to the Cleveland Indians, who were poised to lose several relievers to free agency during the 2018–19 offseason, in exchange for catching prospect Francisco Mejia.[74] On his new team, Hand became a setup man for Cleveland closer Cody Allen, who had 19 saves on the season but had blown several attempts, including a game that Trevor Bauer left 4–0 against the Cincinnati Reds that ended in a 7–4 loss for the Indians.[75] By late August, while Allen remained the de facto closer for the Indians, Hand, who allowed only two earned runs in 14 appearances, was receiving save opportunities.[76][77] After being traded, Hand made 28 appearances for Cleveland, finishing 11 games, and he went 0–1 with a 2.28 ERA while converting eight of 10 save opportunities.[23] The Indians, meanwhile, were the AL Central division champions,[78] giving Hand his first playoff appearance in the 2018 American League Division Series against the Houston Astros.[79] The Astros swept the Indians in the best-of-five series, with Hand allowing Correa's first hit of the series, a three-run home run in Game 3.[80]
Prior to spring training, Indians manager Terry Francona announced that Hand would be the team's closer for the 2019 season.[81] He was 22-for-22 in save opportunities until June 25, when Hunter Dozier hit a grand slam against Hand in the ninth inning of the Indians' game against the Royals, giving Kansas City a three-run lead. Hand's ERA jumped from 1.05 to 2.36 after the outing, and the Indians lost 8–6.[82] He received his third consecutive All-Star Game selection in 2019 after striking out 52 batters in 27 appearances.[83] Hand was far less successful in the second half of the season, which he attributed to a mechanical issue with his slider delivery.[84] After his first blown save, he had a 6.95 ERA, a .347 batting average against, and five more blown saves in 22 innings.[85] Following a stretch of 19 games in which Hand allowed 12 earned runs on 26 hits for a 6.00 ERA, the Indians sent their pitcher back to Cleveland in the middle of a road trip to undergo medical imaging.[86] He was sidelined between September 9 and 20 with what was described as a ""tired arm"", after which he made only one more appearance to finish out the season.[87] In 60 appearances for Cleveland, Hand went 6–4 with a 3.30 ERA and converted 34 of 39 save opportunities while striking out 84 batters in 57+1⁄3 innings.[23]
The Washington Nationals, who had lost their only left-handed reliever after Sean Doolittle became a free agent that offseason, signed Hand to a one-year, $10.5 million contract on January 26, 2021.[101] Serving once again as his team's closer, Hand blew his first regular-season save since 2019 on May 8 against the Yankees. He first took the game into extra innings by allowing DJ LeMahieu to tie in the ninth inning.[102] Trea Turner put the Nationals up 3–2 in the top of the 10th inning, but Hand allowed a Mike Ford RBI to tie the game again, and Tanner Rainey lost the game 4–3 when he allowed Gleyber Torres to walk off in the 11th.[103] After more difficult outings raised Hand's May ERA to 7.56, he made a fastball adjustment that was followed by two clean saves in a row.[104] He was more successful from May 22 to July 20, with a 1.52 ERA in 22 appearances during that stretch, but ended his tenure in Washington with seven runs allowed in 2+2⁄3 innings in his last three appearances.[105] Limited by his difficulties in finding the strike zone,[106] Hand was 5–5 with a 3.59 ERA in 41 appearances for the Nationals, and he converted 21 of 26 save opportunities.[23]
On March 16, 2022, the Philadelphia Phillies signed Hand to a one-year, $6 million contract.[116] Interim manager Rob Thomson did not assign relief pitchers to specific innings, and Hand was instead utilized in late innings when the Phillies were set to face a string of left-handed batters.[117] He saw increased usage in August when Corey Knebel and Seranthony Domínguez were both sideliend with injuries,[118] before landing on the injured list with left elbow tendinitis at the end of September.[119] Hand appeared in 55 regular-season games for the Phillies, going 3–2 with a 2.80 ERA and five saves in 45 innings.[23] The Phillies advanced to the postseason for the first time since 2011,[120] with Hand making seven appearances in the postseason. This included two shutout innings against the Houston Astros during the 2022 World Series, which Philadelphia lost in six games.[121]"

He portrays a tecnico (""Good guy"") wrestling character. Guerrero Maya Jr.'s real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.[4] He is the son of Esteban Mares Castañeda, better known under the ring names Black Terry and Guerrero Maya. He has previously competed as the enmascarado characters Samba and Multifacético (the third person to use that name).
The man known under the ring name Guerrero Maya Jr. earned a degree in Business Administration from a European University before his professional wrestling career, noting that it was important to him to have a well rounded background, to combine intellect with skill.[3] Maya Jr. does a lot of charity work through his employer Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), including visiting sick children at various hospitals around Mexico, stating that he appreciates his career giving him opportunities like that.[5] In late 2010 Guerrero Maya Jr. contracted Hepatitis A, but was able to fully recover after a month away from the ring, returning to active competition on February 1, 2011.[6] It was not until his debut in CMLL that it was revealed that Guerrero Maya Jr. was the son of Esteban Mares Castañeda, who is better known under the ring names Black Terry and Guerrero Maya as they revealed that he was the son of ""Guerrero Maya"".[Note 1][7]
He made his professional wrestling debut in 2005, working as the enmascarado (masked) character Samba. He had been trained for his professional wrestling career by El Reo, El Dandy and Black Terry, and would receive additional training from El Satánico and Franco Columbo once he began working for CMLL.[3] As Samba he worked mainly on the Mexican Independent circuit in Mexico State, although he made a low card debut for International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) wrestling promotion in early 2007.
The Multifacético stopped appearing on IWRG shows in early 2009 with no explanation for the disappearance. A few months later CMLL announced that the son of retired enmascarado Guerrero Maya was joining CMLL, using the ring name Guerrero Maya Jr. This announcement was the first official confirmation that the former Multifacético was actually the son of Black Terry, since Black Terry played the Guerrero Maya character.[4] Guerrero Maya Jr. made his in-ring debut on May 31, 2009 alongside a number of other new wrestlers signed to CMLL.[10] Of the group of wrestlers he started with, which included Hijo del Sicodelico, As Jr. and Rene Guarjardo Jr. he was the only one who remained with CMLL for long. Initially he wore an aquamarine and black mask and full body suit.[11] He would later change his color scheme and mask design to a black base with green, pink and blue colors, including a visible ""M"" logo reminiscent of the Multifacético mask.[2]
In May, 2015 Guerrero Maya Jr. competed in a qualifying match for the 2015 version of En Busca de un Ídolo with as one of 16 wrestlers in the qualifying torneo cibernetico, elimination match where the last eight wrestlers would qualify for the tournament. He competed against Akuma, Blue Panther Jr., Cancerbero, Canelo Casas, Delta, Disturbio, Esfinge, Flyer, El Gallo, Joker, Pegasso, Raziel, Sagrado, Stigma and Boby Zavala.[35] He eliminated Raziel and was one of the survivors to qualify for the main portion of the tournament.[36][37] Maya Jr. earned 100 points out of a possible 140 points by winning 5 matches, losing only to Boby Zavala and Esfinge. Maya Jr. also scored favorable points from the judges, El Tirantes, El Hijo del Gladiador, Shocker and a rotating judge, earning a total of 213 points, an average of 7.6, the second highest of the first round.[38] With 225 points from the fan polls Guerrero Maya Jr. ended up in first place after the first round with a total of 538 points, thus qualifying for the second round of the tournament.[38] In the finals Guerrero Maya Jr. lost to Bobby Zavala. On December 19, 2015 Guerrero Maya Jr, teaming with The Panther regained the CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship from La Comando Caribeño, making Guerrero Maya Jr. the first wrestler in the modern age to win that championship twice.[39] In January 2016, Guerrero Maya Jr. made his Japanese debut by taking part in the CMLL and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) co-produced Fantastica Mania 2016 tour.[40] On the fifth show of the tour, he and The Panther successfully defended the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship against Boby Z and Okumura.[41] On December 25, 2016 Guerrero Maya Jr and  The Panther lost the title against Black Terry and Negro Navarro, two independent wrestlers who do not work for CMLL, the match took place at the Lucha Memes show ""Chairo 7: Hell In a Christmas Cell"", a non-CMLL show."

O’Reilly was born in Corgreagh, Kill, Cootehill, County Cavan on 10 April 1944, the son of Terence and Maureen O'Reilly.[1] He later moved with his family to Kilconny, Belturbet, attending primary school at Drumnatrade and Tullyvin National Schools and secondary school at St Patrick’s College, Cavan.[2]
He was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Kilmore on 15 June 1969.[2]
Following ordination, O'Reilly's first diocesan appointment was as teacher at St Patrick’s College until 1976, where he taught mathematics, science and religion. He went to Rome in 1976 for further studies, serving on the staff of the Pontifical Irish College between 1978 and 1980, and completing a doctorate in biblical theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1981.[1]
O'Reilly returned to the Diocese of Kilmore in 1981, where he was appointed chaplain to Bailieborough Community School.[1]

O'Reilly was appointed coadjutor bishop-elect of Kilmore by Pope John Paul II on 12 November 1996. He was consecrated by the Bishop of Kilmore, Francis McKiernan, on 2 February 1997 in the Cathedral of Saint Patrick and Saint Felim, Cavan.[1]
Following the retirement of McKiernan as Bishop of Kilmore on 16 October 1998, O'Reilly succeeded to the see with immediate effect. He was subsequently installed on 15 November in the Cathedral of Saint Patrick and Saint Felim, Cavan.[1]
A report published by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church on 30 November 2011 found that the Diocese of Kilmore was a ""model of best practice"" in the area of child protection, mainly due to O'Reilly's ""personal commitment and diligence"".[3]

The report stated that allegations had been identified against seven priests in the diocese, all of which had been received since 1975, and that all allegations were addressed and reported to the Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive or preceding health boards. It was also reported that no examples of ""poor practice"" were found following O'Reilly's elevation to the episcopate in 1998, and his approach to child protection was praised as an ""excellent example"" for others to follow.[4]
However, it was reported on 18 December that a priest at the centre of abuse allegations and complaints continued to live in a parochial house in the diocese, despite repeated requests from O'Reilly that he move to alternative accommodation.[5]
Following the passing of a referendum on liberalising abortion laws on 25 May 2018, O'Reilly admitted that the Catholic Church in Ireland is in a ""new reality"" where it is no longer the dominant voice in society, adding that many people in Ireland were Catholic ""by culture rather than convention"".[12]"

Anhalt is the president of Banking On Kids,[6] a company that helps K-8 students become fiscally prudent by opening student-run-banks in their schools.[7] Founded in 1995 by Anhalt,[8][9] his initiatives represented an example of local banks becoming involved in elementary and middle school education: In 1999, the organization started programs in 75 schools with the help of 15 banks in the Milwaukee area. The program, which is curricular-driven, sets many goals for students, such as opening their own savings account.[10] Anhalt believes the program is beneficial because it helps students set financial habits early on.[4][11][12] Anhalt has also stated that another goal of the organization is to reduce the use of check-cashing services, which he called ""legalized loan sharking.""[9] Such services take a significant percentage cut from the value of the check, and Anhalt argues that more emphasis needs to be placed on individuals saving money and using banks.[9]
Under his organization, Just Like Downtown, Anhalt marketed, promoted, and coordinated several promotional events in the Milwaukee area. For instance, he promoted several ""best of"" contests featuring local foods such as frozen custard, fish fries, and pizza.[3][13] He also organized and promoted the idea for the Park-it Market at County Stadium in 1982, which was a flea market described as ""Milwaukee's biggest rummage sale ever."" The event attracted 600 sellers and an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 attendees.[14][15] Anhalt was noted for his atypical promotional strategy, such as using WBCS radio as a method to advertise the event.[13]"

After just one year in college at Virginia, he signed with Columbus Crew as the 12th Homegrown Player in club history. Keita made his professional debut in 2019 while on loan to Richmond Kickers in USL League One.
Although he was born in New York City, Keita was raised in Guinea, moved to Westerville, Ohio, at the age of 10 and attended Westerville North High School. As a sophomore, he was named Honorable Mention All-Ohio Capital Conference while primarily playing as a forward.[3] He joined the Crew Academy in 2016, playing in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy for the U16/17 and U18/19 teams and scoring once in 43 appearances.[4] Keita also trained with the Crew's first team and played against Charleston Battery at the 2018 Carolina Challenge Cup.[5]
In January 2018, Keita took part in his first international camp, training with an assembled United States U19 national team in Lakewood Ranch, Florida.[6] Later that month, he committed to play collegiately for coach George Gelnovatch at the University of Virginia.[7]
Keita made his debut for Virginia on August 24, 2018, starting the season-opener against nationally ranked New Hampshire. He played the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 victory over the Wildcats.[8] On September 28, he scored his first collegiate goal as part of a 2–0 victory against Pittsburgh.[9] Keita appeared in all three postseason games for the Cavaliers, although they lost in the first round of the ACC Men's Soccer Tournament and were eliminated in the third round of the NCAA tournament.[10] After concluding his lone collegiate season with one goal in 17 appearances, Keita was named to the Atlantic Coast Conference All-Freshman Team[11] and earned an invite to a camp for the United States U20 national team.[12]
On January 22, 2019, Keita was announced as the 12th Homegrown Player (HGP) signing in Columbus Crew history. He became the third HGP on the roster for Columbus' 2019 season, joining Wil Trapp and Alex Crognale.[13] Keita had attended his first Crew game at the age of 12 and as a Crew Academy player had previously trained with the first team in prior years.[14]

In a bid to get acclimated to the professional game, Keita was sent on loan to USL League One club Richmond Kickers on March 6, 2019. The loan was for the duration of the 2019 USL League One season, with Columbus able to recall him at any point during the year.[15] Although he began the season back in Columbus, recuperating from an injury suffered while on international duty,[16] Keita made his professional debut on April 27. Against Chattanooga Red Wolves, he replaced Scott Thomsen in the 77th minute and helped Richmond see out a 1–0 victory.[17]
After earning previous camp call-ups for the United States U17, U18, and U19 national teams, Keita earned his first youth caps with the United States U20 team in March 2019. In the team's final camp ahead of the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup, he came off the bench against France on March 22 and provided Christian Cappis with a match-tying assist in second-half stoppage time;[25] Keita also started three days later against Japan.[26] On May 10, he was named to the final roster for the tournament by head coach Tab Ramos.[27] Keita started all five games for the United States, playing every minute of the tournament until being subbed off in the 86th minute of the team's quarterfinal match against Ecuador.[28] Throughout the tournament, he was noted to be sound defensively but struggled with distribution.[29][30][31]"

His other Oscar-nominated roles were in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), I Never Sang for My Father (1970), and Mississippi Burning (1988).
Eugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, United States, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).[4][5] He has a brother named Richard. Hackman has Pennsylvania Dutch, English, and Scottish ancestry. His mother was born in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada.[6] Hackman's family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice.[7] His father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local newspaper. Hackman decided that he wanted to become an actor at age 10.[8] His parents divorced when he was 13 and his father subsequently left the family.[9][10]
In 1956, Hackman began pursuing an acting career. He joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California,[13] where he befriended another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman.[13] Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, Hackman and Hoffman were voted ""The Least Likely To Succeed"",[16][13] and Hackman got the lowest score the Pasadena Playhouse had yet given.[17] Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described Hackman, Hoffman, and Robert Duvall as struggling California-born actors and close friends, sharing NYC apartments in various two-person combinations in the 1960s.[18][19] To support himself between acting jobs, Hackman was working at a Howard Johnson's restaurant[20] when he encountered an instructor from the Pasadena Playhouse, who said that his job proved that Hackman ""wouldn't amount to anything"".[21] A Marine officer who saw him as a doorman said ""Hackman, you're a sorry son of a bitch"". Rejection motivated Hackman, who said:
In 1963 he made his Broadway debut in Children From Their Games which only had a short run as did A Rainy Day in Newark. However Any Wednesday with actress Sandy Dennis was a huge Broadway success in 1964. This opened the door to film work. His first credited role was in Lilith, with Jean Seberg and Warren Beatty in the leading roles.
Hackman was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award from the Golden Globe Awards for his ""outstanding contribution to the entertainment field"" in 2003.[33]
Hackman has been married twice. He has three children from his first marriage.
In 1956, Hackman married Faye Maltese (1929–2017),[43][44] with whom he had one son and two daughters: Christopher Allen, Elizabeth Jean, and Leslie Anne Hackman.[45] He was often out on location making films while the children were growing up.[46] The couple divorced in 1986, after three decades of marriage.[47]"

Aside from being a professional fighter, Alves has been a striking coach at the American Top Team since 2017.[3]
Born and raised in Fortaleza, Brazil, Alves began training in Muay Thai at the age of 15 in order to get in better shape before transitioning to mixed martial arts at the age of 17. Alves won his first MMA bout as an amateur at just 15 years old, defeating a 25-year-old competitor by unanimous decision. At 19, Alves relocated from Brazil to Coconut Creek, Florida to train full-time at the prestigious American Top Team camp.

At 19, Alves relocated from Brazil to Coconut Creek, Florida to train full-time at the prestigious American Top Team camp.
At Ultimate Fight Night 5, Alves was matched up against fellow up-and-comer Jon Fitch. In a match-up of two future top welterweight contenders, Fitch defeated Alves via TKO at 4:37 into the second round after landing a flush upkick to the face of Alves which dropped him and led to Fitch finishing the fight with strikes.
""Pitbull"" completed a busy 2006, during which he fought four times. At UFC 66, he dominated Tony DeSouza, knocking out the jiu-jitsu black belt with a knee in the second round. Following his victory, it was announced that Alves tested positive for a diuretic, spironolactone, which he supposedly used to help him lose water weight in order to make the 170-pound limit.[5] As a result of the failed drug test, Alves was suspended eight months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and fined $5,500.[6]
In his first bout of 2008 at UFC Fight Night 13, Alves faced his biggest test to date, as he was matched up against welterweight contender Karo Parisyan. After resisting any attempts to grapple but failing to amount any significant offense during the stand-up exchanges throughout the first round, ""The Pitbull"" scored a knee to the head of Parisyan, knocking down the judo expert before finishing him on the ground with strikes.
Once again taking just two months between bouts, Alves accepted a fight against former UFC Welterweight Champion Matt Hughes, a fighter widely considered the most dominant champion in UFC history. The Welterweight bout, which served as the main event of UFC 85 in London, was scheduled as a late replacement after Chuck Liddell had to pull out of his headliner fight against Rashad Evans with a hamstring injury.
Prior to the bout, Alves surprised many by missing weight for the welterweight bout—coming in at 174 pounds.[8] Despite his opponent missing the 170-pound limit, Hughes accepted the fight at a catchweight. Despite the pre-fight blunder, Alves shocked the crowd by dominating the heavily favored former champion. After picking apart Hughes standing and displaying vastly-improved takedown defense throughout the first round, ""The Pitbull"" knocked Hughes down with a flying knee and followed him to the ground with punches early in the second, earning a TKO stoppage. This win earned Alves his first Knockout of the Night bonus award.[9] In the post fight interview, Alves attributed not making weight to spraining his ankle two weeks before the fight.
Josh Koscheck, another top-contender and four-time NCAA wrestling All-American, stepped in for Sanchez on short notice.[11] Alves controlled most of the fight and won via unanimous decision (30–27, 29–28, and 30–27).[12] The Brazilian's improved takedown-defense was once again on display, as the American Top Team fighter forced Koscheck into a kick boxing battle. Alves' devastating leg kicks proved to be a factor throughout the bout, taking away much of Koscheck's mobility. He also managed to drop Koscheck several times during the 3-round bout, but Koscheck's quick recovery enabled him to survive the onslaughts.[13]
With his impressive victory over Koscheck, Alves was on a 7-fight win streak, winning 9 of his past 10 bouts. After consecutive dominant performances against Parisyan, Hughes and Koscheck, Dana White announced that Alves had earned a title shot against the winner of the welterweight title-fight at UFC 94. After Georges St-Pierre defended his title at UFC 94, Alves entered the ring to congratulate him. St. Pierre said that he was looking forward to facing Alves in the cage.[14] Thiago Alves fought Georges St-Pierre for the welterweight title at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas on 11 July 2009 at UFC 100.[15] During the fight, Alves was taken down a total of ten times. Although he showed potential on his feet and put in a resilient performance on the ground, continually getting back up, he was ultimately subjected to a clinic put on by St. Pierre and being outwrestled in all five rounds ultimately losing via unanimous decision (50–45, 50–44, and 50–45).
With his impressive victory over Koscheck, Alves was on a 7-fight win streak, winning 9 of his past 10 bouts. After consecutive dominant performances against Parisyan, Hughes and Koscheck, Dana White announced that Alves had earned a title shot against the winner of the welterweight title-fight at UFC 94.

The Alves/Fitch rematch, originally slated for UFC 107, then UFC 111,[22] then UFC 115,[23] finally took place at UFC 117.[24] This fight was confirmed to be the number one contendership for the welterweight championship (to fight the winner of the St-Pierre/Koscheck bout). Alves again failed to make weight, weighing in at 171.5 lb, meaning he had to give up 20% of his fight purse. Alves would go on to lose to Fitch via unanimous decision.[25] Dana White stated in the post fight press conference that Alves could be moving to the middleweight division.[26]

Days later, Alves said that he'd been given one more chance by the UFC to compete as a welterweight.[27]
Alves was expected to face Al Iaquinta in a lightweight bout on 12 November 2016 at UFC 205.[52] However, Iaquinta announced on 19 September that he would not be taking the fight due to a contract dispute with the promotion.[53] Alves was rescheduled to face Jim Miller at the event.[54] At the weigh-ins, Alves missed weight by nearly seven pounds, weighing in at 162.6 lbs. Miller, who was already on weight, had to rehydrate to keep their weight difference within 7 pounds. Because of that, he came in at 157.6 lbs and the bout proceeded at catchweight. New York State Athletic Commission and UFC officials indicated that Alves must not weigh more than 173 lbs the day of the fight or the fight would be cancelled. As a result, Alves was fined 20% of his fight purse, which went to Miller.[55] He lost the fight by unanimous decision.[56]
After the failed attempt at lightweight, Alves returned to welterweight and faced Patrick Côté on 8 April 2017 at UFC 210.[57] He won the fight by unanimous decision.[58]
On 22 January 2020, news surfaced that Alves had signed a three-fight contract with Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship.[77][78] He was expected to make his promotional debut against Phil Baroni, however Baroni was removed from the card as the organization could not reach him in timely fashion.[79] Instead, he made his promotional debut against former contender from The Ultimate Fighter, Julian Lane, at BKFC 12 in Daytona Beach, FL on 11 September 2020[80] Alves won the fight by split decision.[81]
Alves then faced Ulysses Diaz for the inaugural middleweight championship at BKFC 18 on 26 June 2021.[82] He claimed the championship via technical knockout after the ringside doctor stopped the bout after the third round.[83]
His contract with BKFC expired on 12 May 2022, so he was stripped of the BKFC Middleweight Championship.[84]
Aside from his mixed martial arts athlete and coach careers, Alves was in the process of becoming a police officer in Florida.[88] However, there are no plans to become a police officer as he will focus on his coaching at American Top Team and being a director for an online training platform called Life Training.[89][90]"

A former member of the Labour Party, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Falkirk, formerly Falkirk West, from 2000 to 2015.
Joining the army in his teens, Joyce served as a private in the Black Watch before attending the University of Stirling and subsequently receiving a commission in the Royal Army Educational Corps. He resigned from the army under threat of discharge in 1999 at the rank of major after being found to have broken Queen's Regulations. He then worked as the Public Affairs Officer at the Commission for Racial Equality (Scotland).
Joyce persuaded the Treasury to change the child benefit regulations to remove a discrepancy that disadvantaged young Scottish FE students relative to their peers in the rest of the UK.[16] In April 2008, Joyce became the first European parliamentarian to be granted an opportunity to address the newly formed Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, when he visited the DRC as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on the Great Lakes Region of Africa with other members of the group.[17] In September 2008, Joyce was criticised by local government councillors for describing the name of the new Clackmannanshire Bridge as ""unimaginative"" and ""parochial"".[18] The naming of the bridge was reported as a contentious matter.[19][20]
The following day Joyce was suspended from the Labour party.[38] He pleaded guilty to four charges in relation to the incident,[39] was fined £3,000 and ordered to pay £1,400 in compensation to his victims, but not given a custodial sentence.[39] In a statement before the House of Commons on 12 March 2012, he apologised to his victims, stated that he had resigned from the Labour Party, and that he intended to complete his current term as an MP but not seek re-election.[40]  In August 2012, Joyce was fined £600 for removing the electronic tag that had been fitted to his leg as part of the community order.[41]
On 6 November 2018, Joyce was arrested and charged with having made an indecent image of a child. He had a 51-second Category-A film on his Apple Macbook Air[50] that showed ""the sexual abuse of very young children"" between the ages of 12 months and 7 years. The video was accessed by Joyce between August 2013 and November 2018.[51] He was given unconditional bail.[52] On 7 July 2020, Joyce pleaded guilty at Ipswich Crown Court to making an indecent image of a child and was ordered to sign the sex offenders' register.[53] On 7 August 2020, he was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years, and also ordered to perform 150 hours of community service.[54]"

His government is considered autocratic.
Born in Ntungamo, Museveni studied political science from the University of Dar es Salaam where he initiated the University Students' African Revolutionary Front. In 1972, he participated in the abortive invasion of Uganda against the regime of President Idi Amin. The next year, Museveni established the Front for National Salvation and fought alongside Tanzanian forces in the Tanzania–Uganda War, which overthrew Amin. Museveni contested the subsequent 1980 general election on the platform of Uganda Patriotic Movement, though claimed electoral fraud after losing to the unpopular Milton Obote. Museveni unified the opposition under the National Resistance Movement and started the Ugandan Bush War. In January 1986, after the decisive Battle of Kampala, Museveni was sworn as president.
On 16 January 2021, Museveni was reelected to a sixth term with 58.6% of the vote, despite many videos and reports showing ballot box stuffing, over 400 polling stations with 100% voter turnout and human rights violations. As of 2022[update], after 36 years of his authoritarian rule, Uganda has been ranked 166th in GDP (nominal) per capita and 167th by Human Development Index.
Museveni was estimated to be born on 15 September 1944[3] to parents Mzee Amos Kaguta (1916–2013), a cattle keeper, and Esteri Kokundeka Nganzi (1918–2001), in Ntungamo. He is an ethnic Hima of the kingdom of Mpororo (now part of Ankole).[4][5]
Museveni was estimated to be born on 15 September 1944[3] to parents Mzee Amos Kaguta (1916–2013), a cattle keeper, and Esteri Kokundeka Nganzi (1918–2001), in Ntungamo. He is an ethnic Hima of the kingdom of Mpororo (now part of Ankole).[4][5]
According to Julius Nyerere, Museveni's father, Amos Kaguta, was a soldier in the King's African Rifles' 7th battalion during World War II. Yoweri was born, relatives used to say, ""His father was a mu-seven"" (meaning ""in the seventh""). This is how he obtained the name Museveni.[6]
His family migrated to Ntungamo,[when?] then within the British Protectorate of Uganda. Museveni attended Kyamate Elementary School, Mbarara High School, and Ntare School for his primary and secondary education. He attended the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania for his tertiary education, where he studied economics and political science. The university at the time was a hot bed of radical pan-African and Marxist political thought. While at university, he formed the University Students' African Revolutionary Front student activist group and led a student delegation to FRELIMO-held territory in Portuguese Mozambique where they received military training. Studying under the leftist Walter Rodney, among others, Museveni wrote a university thesis on the applicability of Frantz Fanon's ideas on revolutionary violence to post-colonial Africa.[7]
Museveni was sworn in as president on 29 January. ""This is not a mere change of guard, it is a fundamental change,"" said Museveni, after a ceremony conducted by British-born Chief Justice Peter Allen. Speaking to crowds of thousands outside the Ugandan parliament, Museveni promised a return to democracy: ""The people of Africa, the people of Uganda, are entitled to a democratic government. It is not a favour from any regime. The sovereign people must be the public, not the government.""[24][25]
In 1997 he introduced free primary education.[36]
In August 1998, Rwanda and Uganda invaded the DRC again during the Second Congo War, this time to overthrow Kabila, who was a former ally of Museveni and Kagame. Museveni and a few close military advisers alone made the decision to send the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) into the DRC. A number of highly placed sources indicate that the Ugandan parliament and civilian advisers were not consulted over the matter, as is required by the 1995 constitution.[48]: 262–263  Museveni apparently persuaded an initially reluctant High Command to go along with the venture. ""We felt that the Rwandese started the war and it was their duty to go ahead and finish the job, but our President took time and convinced us that we had a stake in what is going on in Congo"", one senior officer is reported as saying.[49]
A confidential World Bank report leaked in May suggested that the international lender might cut its support to non-humanitarian programmes in Uganda. ""We regret that we cannot be more positive about the present political situation in Uganda, especially given the country's admirable record through the late 1990s"", said the paper. ""The Government has largely failed to integrate the country's diverse peoples into a single political process that is viable over the long term... Perhaps most significant, the political trend-lines, as a result of the President's apparent determination to press for a third term, point downward.""[68]

During his captivity, Hamas rejected requests from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit Shalit, claiming that such visits could compromise his location.

The Red Cross stated, ""The Shalit family have the right under international humanitarian law to be in contact with their son.""[3] In the early months, the sole means of communication was through an intermediary, who claimed that a low-ranking Hamas official, Ghazi Hamad, asked him to convey to Shalit's parents the assurance that Shalit was ""alive and was treated according to Islam's laws regarding prisoners of war.

Shalit became the first Israeli soldier to be captured by Palestinian militants since the incident involving Nachshon Wachsman in 1994.[19] Shalit held the rank of Corporal in the IDF's Armor Corps at the time of his capture, and he was subsequently promoted to Sergeant, Staff Sergeant, and Sergeant First Class just before his release.[20][21] He holds dual Israeli and French citizenship, the latter via his grandmother.[22]
Shalit was born on 28 August 1986 in Nahariya, Israel, to Noam and Aviva Shalit. He has an older brother and a younger sister. He was raised from in Mitzpe Hila in the Western Galilee.[23] He graduated with distinction from Manor Kabri High School. Shalit began military service in the Israel Defense Forces in July 2005, and ""despite a low medical rating, chose to serve in a combat unit, following his older brother, Yoel, into the armored corps.""[24]

The high-ranking Hamas commander whom Israel considers responsible for masterminding Shalit's capture, Abu Jibril Shimali, was killed during the violent clashes between Hamas and the al-Qaida-affiliated Jund Ansar Allah organization in Gaza in August 2009.[33]
Israeli forces entered Khan Yunis on 28 June 2006 to restore quiet after repeated rocket attacks. Freeing Shalit was not one of the objectives of the mission called ""Summer Rains"". According to an Israeli embassy spokesperson, ""Israel did everything it could in exhausting all diplomatic options and gave Mahmoud Abbas the opportunity to return the abducted Israeli… This operation can be terminated immediately, conditioned on the release of Gilad Shalit.""[34] On the same day, four Israeli Air Force aircraft flew over Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's palace in Latakia, because Israel views the Syrian leadership as a sponsor of Hamas, according to an IDF spokesperson.[35] The operation did not succeed in finding Shalit.
He also said: ""We have managed to keep the soldier in captivity for six months and we have no problem keeping him for years.""[44] On 17 January 2007, one of the captor groups, the Army of Islam headed by Mumtaz Dormush, claimed that Shalit was being held exclusively by Hamas.[45] On 8 March 2007, Jerusalem Post reported that an agreement had been reached with Hamas over the number of prisoners Israel would release in return for Shalit. Israel and Hamas were still negotiating specific prisoners who Hamas wanted freed in return for Shalit. On 7 April 2007, it was reported that Shalit's captors had transferred to Israel, through Egyptian mediators, a list of Palestinian prisoners they wanted freed. The list included names of approximately 1,300 prisoners, some of whom were high-ranking Fatah members.[citation needed]
Shalit's father, Noam, met with former United States President Jimmy Carter during Carter's April 2008 visit to Israel. Carter planned to visit Hamas leader Khaled Mashal in Damascus later. Noam Shalit said that the fact that Carter was not considered pro-Israel could be beneficial in securing his son's release. On 9 June 2008, it was reported that Hamas sent Shalit's family a third letter. The group had promised to send them a third letter after mediation from Carter. The handwriting was confirmed to be Shalit's.[47]
On 20 August 2008, in his briefing to the United Nations Security Council, the Under-Secretary-General of the UN appeared to link the decision to release 200 Palestinian prisoners to the case,[49] though a Hamas spokesman saw it as an attempt to increase Palestinian internal divisions by releasing only those loyal to the Fatah faction.[50]
President Peres publicly thanked Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for showing compassion to Shalit. On 18 October 2011, Shalit was transferred to Israel. The IDF transferred him, via helicopter, to the base in Tel-Nof, where he was reunited with his parents and met the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In the base he went through medical tests; it was found that he was malnourished and suffered from vitamin deficiencies.[63] After the tests were completed, he was then transferred by helicopter to his home, where many who supported his release waited outside his house to see his return. Shalit subsequently began to rehabilitate with IDF assistance.[64]
In July 2009, Noam Shalit, Gilad's father, testified before the Goldstone Committee, which was investigating on behalf of the United Nations illegal conduct by combatants during Gaza War. Shalit told the committee that his son has lived without human rights for three years, and that no one, including the Red Cross, knows what happened to him or has paid him a visit.[85] The Jerusalem Post reported that it obtained photographs showing children at the graduation ceremony of a Hamas-run summer camp, reenacting Shalit's abduction. The photos were reported to show Osama Mazini, a senior Hamas political official in charge of the Shalit negotiations with Israel, attending the play.[86]
In 2010, at least two cathedrals in Switzerland turned off their lights for several minutes in solidarity with Shalit.[90] On the fourth anniversary of Shalit's abduction, the lights of the Colosseum were turned off. and so were the lights around the Old City walls in Jerusalem. A flotilla of ships, called The True Freedom Flotilla, sailed around the Statue of Liberty and past the United Nations.[91]
Shalit stated that he had some good things such as television, radio, food, and opportunities to play checkers and dominos with the guards. He stated that they ""did not abuse [him] too much"". Shalit stated that he kept a regular schedule such as getting up and going to bed at the same time every day, learned some Arabic, and chatted with his captors about sports.[110]
In June 2011, the Zionist Federation, among other organizations, stepped up a campaign to ensure that Shalit and his abduction are not forgotten, encouraging members and sympathizers to contact their local MP, MEP and to write letters to newspapers and to Shalit's family with words of support.[116] This followed a two-week Gilad Shalit Awareness Campaign in February, organized by the Embassy of Israel alongside ten other community organizations.
The Israeli Defense Ministry, in anticipation of his release, determined that Shalit would be accorded the status of a disabled veteran with a minimum of 20% disability immediately following his liberation from captivity. At the time of his abduction, Shalit held the rank of corporal, but he was promoted to sergeant during his captivity. Upon his release, Shalit returned to his parents' residence in Mitzpe Hila, an event that garnered substantial attention both within Israel and internationally, resulting in the presence of numerous media outlets and ordinary citizens in Mitzpe Hila. In an act of consideration for Shalit's privacy, many Israeli media organizations committed to limiting extensive coverage of his return.[122]
In January 2012, Noam Shalit, Gilad's father, declared his intention to participate as a candidate in the Israeli Labor Party's primaries for the Knesset.[125][126] On April 18, 2012, Gilad Shalit was honorably discharged from the IDF with the rank of sergeant major.[127]
In June 2012, Shalit, known for his enthusiasm for sports and his support for Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C., secured employment as a sports reporter for Yedioth Ahronoth, where he contributed a regular column covering Israeli and European basketball. His inaugural assignment took him to the United States to report on the 2012 NBA Finals in Oklahoma City.[133][134]"

Under Tollett, the Eagles have appeared in two NCAA Division I Tournaments and won Atlantic Sun Conference (A-Sun) regular season championships in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2014, 2019, and 2021.Tollett's 2017 season was the most successful in program history as the Green and Blue won a program record 43 games, claimed the program's first ASUN Tournament championship, and advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time. After starting the season 24–3 and defeating then #2 and eventual National Champion Florida, then #1 FSU and Miami in the same season for the first time ever, FGCU rose to as high as #9 in the Collegiate Baseball News poll - marking the highest ranking ever achieved by any athletics program in school history. Following the hot start to the season, Tollett was named the Perfect Game Midseason Coach of the Year. The Green and Blue suffered a number of tough losses in April, but ended the regular season by sweeping its way through its final three conference series and earned the No. 3 seed in the ASUN Tournament. After falling into the loser's bracket following a loss on day two, FGCU won an improbable four elimination games in less than 30 hours and defeated top-seeded Jacksonville twice, including an extra-inning thriller in the winner-take-all championship. With the ASUN's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament in hand, the Eagles earned the No. 2 seed in the Chapel Hill Regional and defeated No. 3 Michigan, 10–6, in its first-ever NCAA tournament game. Tollett was named the A-Sun Coach of the Year in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2014, and 2019.  Worst loss of career came during the 2013 season when Tollett and the Eagles lost to an NAIA school, Ave Maria.

Collaros signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after going undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft but did not make the team.[7][9]
Collaros signed a contract to play for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League in June 2012.[10][11] He played in one game during the 2012 CFL season, completing seven of 11 passes for 101 yards and one touchdown. In the first preseason game of the 2013 CFL season he completed nine of 12 passes for 95 yards and one touchdown. On July 30, he had his first CFL start in place of the injured Ricky Ray, as the Argonauts defeated the B.C. Lions at the Rogers Centre. He threw for three touchdowns and completed 21 of 25 passes for 253 yards.[12][13] Collaros had an outstanding 2013 season. He played in 14 games that season and was the starting quarterback for eight games, due to an injury to Ricky Ray. He completed 190 of 287 pass attempts at a strong completion percentage of 66.2%. He threw for 2,316 yards, 14 touchdowns and only six interceptions, for a quarterback rating of 98.4. He was not selected by the Ottawa Redblacks in the 2013 CFL Expansion Draft because he was set to become a free agent in February 2014. The Redblacks did not want to risk their selections on players who may not re-sign with their new team. Collaros was set to become a free-agent in February 2014 if a contract extension could not be agreed upon by the Argos. Upon understanding that Collaros would not re-sign with the Argos and would instead test the free-agent market, Argos general manager Jim Barker decided to release Collaros prior to the start of free agency. After failing to come to terms on a new contract, the Argonauts released Collaros on January 29, 2014.[14]

On May 4, 2016, Tiger-Cats head coach Kent Austin announced that Collaros would be limited in training camp, and likely miss the start of the 2016 regular season as he recovers from his torn ACL injury.[17] On June 19, three days before the season commenced, Austin confirmed that Collaros would not be starting the season as he continued to rehab his knee.[18] Prior to Week 8, and almost 11 months since sustaining his knee injury, Collaros returned to practising with the first team offense.[19] Collaros made his season debut in time for the team's Week 8 match against the BC Lions.[20] The following season, on August 29, 2017, after an 0–8 start to the 2017 season, Tiger-Cats head coach June Jones announced that Jeremiah Masoli would get the start at quarterback in Week 11 over Collaros.[21] Collaros did not start another game for the Tiger-Cats in the 2017 season. By all accounts, 2017 was the worst season of Collaros' career. Not only did he not win a game, he also posted a career low quarterback efficiency rating of 88.1 and career low completion percentage (62.8%). His touchdown-to-interception ratio (8:7) was also the lowest of his career.
On January 3, 2018, Collaros was traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders for a 2nd round pick in the 2018 CFL Draft.[22] On January 19, 2018, Collaros agreed to a restructured contract with the Riders.[23] Prior to the restructured deal Collaros was set to make $500,000 in 2018, plus a $200,000 roster bonus due February 1, 2018.[24] Collaros suffered a concussion in the team's Week 2 loss to the Ottawa Redblacks.[25] In the following week Collaros was placed on the six-game injured reserve.[26] Collaros played in 14 regular season games during the 2018 regular season, leading the Riders to a 12-6 record and a home playoff game.[27] Collaros was unable to play in the Western Semi-Final playoff game because of a concussion, and the Riders were defeated by the Blue Bombers 23-18, ending their season.[28][29] Collaros re-signed with the Riders on the opening day of free agency, February 12, 2019, for a one-year contract.[30] Collaros was knocked out of the first game of the season when he was hit in the head by Ti-Cats linebacker Simoni Lawrence while attempting to slide.[31] Collaros was subsequently placed on the 6-game injured list.[32]
On July 31, 2019, Collaros was traded to the Toronto Argonauts in exchange for a conditional fourth round pick in the 2020 CFL Draft. The pick could have been upgraded to as high as a second-round pick in that draft if Collaros had met playing time targets and extension clauses.[33] In early September 2019, Collaros was still unable to participate in practice because of the concussion he suffered in Week 1.[34] However, by the end of the month he was throwing the ball in practice.[35]
Collaros was traded to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, on the CFL's 2019 trade deadline day, October 9, 2019, along with an exchange of draft picks in the 2020 CFL Draft.[36] The Bombers had lost starting quarterback Matt Nichols to a season ending injury earlier in the season and the Bombers had lost four of their last five games with Chris Streveler under centre.[37] Prior to the last game of the regular season, Collaros started taking first-team reps in practice for the Bombers, and was announced as the starting quarterback on October 24, 2019, taking over for an injured Streveler.[38][39] Collaros threw his first passes of the year to count (his lone attempt for the Roughriders was wiped out due to a defensive penalty) and lead the Blue Bombers to a victory in their season finale. Collaros formed a QB tandem with Streveler, where Streveler served primarily as a gritty run option.[40] The two turned what had been a late season slump for the Bombers, into a post-season winning streak that saw Winnipeg defeat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 to win the 107th Grey Cup. Collaros' Grey Cup victory was unique in that he beat Saskatchewan, the team he started the season with in the division finals and then beat Hamilton, whose linebacker Simoni Lawrence had hit him in the head in Week 1 and knocking him out for a significant portion of the season, on his way to the championship.[41] The media had frequently brought these circumstances up and Collaros did not answer them until the final media session after the Grey Cup saying ""What are they calling it? The revenge tour? We finished it. It’s over. Last show tonight.""[41] On January 27, 2020, Collaros and the Bombers agreed to a two-year contract extension, preventing him from becoming a free agent on February 11.[42]
Collaros and his wife, Nicole, own a home in Aurora, Ontario.[52] The couple were acquainted through former Hamilton Tiger-Cats player Andy Fantuz and his wife Amanda, and they were married in February 2019.[52]
He is of Greek Heritage, and is an avid and enthusiastic Greek dancer.[53] Collaros was a roommate of future NFL players Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce in college, and remains good friends with both brothers.[54]"

After having finalized his commitments with Atlético Huila, he terminated his agreement with the club in December 2014 so he could be hired for the 2015 season by the Deportivo Cali, the team that had returned like a helmsman after twelve years. His return to the Deportivo Cali was marked by a brief controversy due to contractual disputes with his old club, since the huilense team did not arrive at an agreement with the Deportivo Cali to cease the agreement that Castro had until June 2015. Due to all this, he was banished from the field at the start of the league game, and had to direct from the grandstand until the legal lawsuit was resolved. After remaining in third place in the confrontation phase between all the teams of the 2015 tournament opening, the Deportivo Cali, directed by Castro, moved to the second phase of the competition, where they were able to surpass the Atlético Nacional, resulting in their instant elimination in the quarter-finals. Playing against the club the Millonarios in the semi-final resulted in facing the Deportivo Independiente Medellín for the title, where they would win and achieve the ninth title for the Deportivo Cali and the second title in his professional career.

Lampros Choutos (sometimes Lambros;[1] born 7 December 1979) is a Greek former professional footballer who played as a striker.
During his career, he played equal periods of time in his country and Italy.
Born in Athens, Choutos started his career with Asteras Polygonou, being discovered by scouts of Panathinaikos FC. After only two years, he moved to Italy to finish his football grooming with AS Roma.
Born in Athens, Choutos started his career with Asteras Polygonou, being discovered by scouts of Panathinaikos FC. After only two years, he moved to Italy to finish his football grooming with AS Roma.
Choutos' first stop as a senior was back in his country, loaned by Roma to Olympiacos F.C. after stellar performances during the qualifying stages for the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, as he netted 15 goals in only ten matches. He gradually made his way into the first team under the direction of Alberto Bigon, forming a productive attacking trio with Slovenia's Zlatko Zahovič and Giovanni from Brazil.
Although he suffered from an injured knee, Choutos managed to score decisive goals. He helped the Piraeus club win the 2000, 2001 and 2003 Superleague championships before returning to Italy, with Inter Milan.
Choutos signed a three-year contract with Inter in summer 2004, but could never settle there, being constantly loaned to other minor sides in both the country and abroad (Spain's RCD Mallorca, where he quickly fell out of favour with manager Héctor Cúper).[2] He made his competitive debut for the Nerazzurri on 9 November 2006, coming on as a 78th-minute substitute for Mariano González in a Coppa Italia clash against F.C. Messina Peloro, which took place more than two years after his arrival;[3] he left at the end of the campaign.

Choutos returned to his country in the 2007 off-season after signing with Panionios FC, but was only eligible to start playing in the following January. He again began experiencing first-team football, and notably scored two of three at Athens Olympic Sports Complex to help defeat hosts AEK Athens F.C. and collect the Man of the match award; he finished his half season with 12 goals, as his team finished in sixth position and participated in the second stage.
Choutos started his second year in scoring fashion, netting twice against OFK Beograd in the UEFA Intertoto Cup (3–1 home win, 3–2 on aggregate). After a run-in with the club's assistant coach that supposedly turned physical, however, the player was forced to leave.
On 2 February 2009, Choutos signed a six-month contract with PAOK FC, appearing in eight scoreless matches. On 25 August he returned to Italy once again, joining lowly A.S. Pescina Valle del Giovenco for two years;[4] his contract was cancelled in July 2010, after the club was excluded from the Italian football league system due to financial issues.

Courtesy of his solid under-21 performances, Choutos soon made his debut for the Greek full side, going on to win ten caps in four years. He was overlooked for the squads that appeared at both UEFA Euro 2004 and 2008.

In the 1980 film Midnight Madness, she played a character that leads a group of sorority sisters who are participating in a college puzzle solving race.[6] Roswell also starred in the sketch comedy The Tim Conway Show in 1980 and 1981.[7][8] She appeared in the film Lost in America (1985) as the character Patty,[9][10] and she had a supporting role in the film Pretty in Pink (1986).[11] She also acted in the two-part television film The Deliberate Stranger.[12] In addition, Roswell played some minor roles in television shows in the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s,[4] including guest appearances on Remington Steele (1983),[13] Masquerade (1984),[14] Happy Days (1984), Murphy Brown (1993), and Quantum Leap (1993).[4] She was offered a chance to replace Gilda Radner on Saturday Night Live, but turned down the offer when her agent told her ""the show wasn't going anywhere.""[11]
Roswell met fellow voice actor Hal Rayle in 1986, and they married in 1987.[22] He had done roles such as the Predator in Predator 2, the ghoulies in Ghoulies II, and Marvin the Martian in Air Jordan commercials.[11] They moved from Los Angeles to Denver, Colorado, in June 1994 to raise their adopted daughter Spenser, who was born in 1993.[11] Between March and November every year,[23] when episodes of The Simpsons were being recorded, Roswell had to fly back to Los Angeles twice a week to attend the table reads and the recording sessions.

His training in both disciplines has helped him express age-old spiritual teachings in clear, logical language. Rajinder has had a twenty-year career in science, computers, and communications.[5][6]
Singh stated that, ""One of the greatest benefits of meditation is that we will not only have peace in our own homes, but will contribute to the peace of the world. Throughout the world, people are praying for peace. But, as the expression goes, charity begins at home. World peace can only become a reality when each of us individually has peace in our own circles. If we bring peace into our individual spheres, the effect will be cumulative, and it will contribute to world peace. In 2000, He was part of a delegation of hundreds of world religious leaders who traveled to New York for the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, ""an event unusual for its religious diversity and for its having convened at the United Nations,"" according to the New York Times.[7] Singh told the Times, ""When we sit and talk with them [leaders of other religions], we realize they are not much different"".[7]
As founder of the Darshan Education Foundation, Singh has established Darshan Academy throughout India (schools that teach students from Pre-K—12).[10] Integrating both meditation and a spiritual curriculum into a traditional academic environment, the foundation's goal is two-fold: first, to produce students whose spiritual potential is developed along with their intellect and physical well-being; and second, to inspire in each student a global view of the world, unobstructed by distinctions of race, nationality, religion, or economic status.

In his address given to students and faculty at IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) Mumbai, Singh states:
“Science and spirituality make a great partnership. If those engaged in science spend time in the silence of their selves, inspiration will come and lead them to the answers they seek. If those interested in spirituality apply the scientific law of testing a hypothesis in the laboratories of their own bodies, they will find results. Each person is capable of success in proving spiritual truths. Such pursuits can make the world a better place as well as uncover the purpose of our lives.”[16]
At the United Nations Headquarters, New York (May 2016), in his keynote address, he explained how meditation on the inner Light and Sound can lead to inner peace, which paves the way to building bridges of unity, love, and outer peace in the world.[31][32][33] At the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, United Nations, New York City, New York (August 2000), in his address entitled ""Nature of Forgiveness and Compassion"" Singh stated: ""Spirituality is the recognition that behind our outer names and labels, we are souls, a part of one Creator. . . . When we develop this vision we no longer see through the eyes of prejudice and discrimination."". He also shared a speech at the UN celebration for Secretary General Kofi Annan.[34][35][36]
At the Sixth Assembly of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, in Riva del Garde, Italy (November 1994), in this talk ""Curing the World’s Pain,"" he stated: ""To heal the world, we must heal ourselves. To bring peace to the world, we must have peace ourselves. We can attain this through meditation.""[38]
Symposium of the World Conference on Religion and Peace in Vienna, Austria (1998). In his address, “Building Peace in the World,” he explored the importance of meditation as the way to connect to our soul and to the divinity that exists within us. He said: “When we recognize that all people of the world are made of the same Light that we are made of, we will feel the pain of others. . . . Our outlook will be a global one, and we will make choices that will benefit our global brothers and sisters.”"

A defensive midfielder by trade, he made more than 300 senior appearances for seven different clubs during a 14-year playing career spent mostly in the top division of French football. He later went into management, firstly as manager of Bordeaux in 1995, and has since held various positions at a number of clubs in France.
In the summer of 1984, Guérit returned to his first club Angoulême.[2] The team had been relegated to Division 3 that year after finishing second-bottom of their group the previous season. Angoulême narrowly missed out on promotion twice over the following two years, ending the campaign in third place in 1985 before finishing as runners-up to Bourges a year later.[3] Guérit was ever-present for the senior team during this period, scoring five goals in 60 league matches.[1] His performances led to interest from clubs at higher levels and in 1986 he was signed by Division 1 side OGC Nice. Over the next three years, he became a regular in the Nice midfield, making 96 league appearances for the club and scoring on six occasions.[1]
Guérit began the 1989–90 season with Nice, playing in the opening three matches, but transferred to nearby rivals Monaco in August 1989.[1] He found his opportunities more limited and was restricted to only 13 games as the club challenged for the title, eventually finishing third, seven points behind champions Marseille. Guérit left Monaco ahead of the 1990–91 campaign, instead opting to sign for Cannes. He played 35 times in his first season with the south-coast outfit, scoring four goals as the team secured a fourth-place finish in Division 1. However, the following campaign was rather less successful for Cannes as they ended the year in 19th position, thereby being relegated to the second tier.[1] Guérit nevertheless remained in the top division, joining Bordeaux in the summer of 1992. He went on to spend three years at the Parc Lescure, making a total of 66 league appearances for Bordeaux before announcing his retirement from football in 1995.[2]

In April 1995, following his retirement from playing, Guérit was hired as Bordeaux manager for the remainder of the season following the departure of Portuguese coach Toni. He guided the team to a seventh-place finish, winning five and drawing one of his eight matches in charge. However, he was not given the job on a permanent basis as the club hired Serbian Slavoljub Muslin as manager for the following season.[4] Guérit left Bordeaux and returned for a third spell at his former side Angoulême, as assistant manager to Guy Latapie. When Latapie left the club in March 1997, Guérit was installed as head coach, a position he held until December of the following year.[2]
After a short spell as assistant manager to Patrice Neveu at Angoulême, Guérit was hired as manager of the reserve team at Lille in 1999. He spent three years in the job, and his time at Lille culminated in the team winning the Championnat de France amateur (CFA) Group A at the end of the 2001–02 season. Shortly afterwards, he was appointed manager at Championnat National side Angers.[1] He guided the team to promotion in his first season in charge, ending the campaign as runners-up to Besançon and thereby returning the club to the second tier after two years in the National. His stay at Angers did not last much longer, however, as he was dismissed and replaced by Jacky Bonnevay in August 2003 after winning only one of the opening five matches of the 2003–04 season.[1]"

His coup triggered the 2023 Nigerien crisis.
Before becoming Commander of the Presidential guard, he led forces in Zinder, Agadez, and Diffa regions where he combated drug trafficking.[7] In 1989, he was the first officer to make it to the site of the UTA Flight 772 crash in the Ténéré desert, for which he was decorated.[8] He also served in UN peacekeeping missions in the Ivory Coast, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.[9] He also served in the Multinational Joint Task Force set up by Niger, Chad, Nigeria and Cameroon to fight Boko Haram.[6]
In 2011, Tchiani assumed command of the Presidential guards and was a close ally of then-President Mahamadou Issoufou, who promoted him to general in 2018. In 2015, Tchiani was accused of involvement in a coup plot against Issoufou but denied the charges in court.[1] He was otherwise seen as keeping his views to himself during that time.[6]
In 2021, Tchiani led the unit that thwarted an attempted coup; at the time a military unit tried to seize the Presidential palace two days before Issoufou stepped down to make way for his democratically elected successor, Mohamed Bazoum, who retained Tchiani in his post.[5]
On 26 July 2023, Tchiani led the Presidential guards in detaining President Bazoum in the Presidential palace in the capital Niamey as part of the 2023 Nigerien coup d'état. The coup was reportedly led by Tchiani, whom analysts said Bazoum had planned to relieve from his position.[10] Sources close to Bazoum said that he had decided on Tchiani's dismissal at a cabinet meeting on 24 July as their relations had reportedly become strained.[11]
On 28 July, Tchiani proclaimed himself as the president of the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland in an address on state television. He said the coup was undertaken to avoid ""the gradual and inevitable demise"" of the country and said that Bazoum had tried to hide ""the harsh reality"" of the country, which he called ""a pile of dead, displaced, humiliation and frustration"". He also criticized the Government's security strategy for its purported ineffectiveness but did not give a timeline for a return to civilian rule.[12][1][13]"

He later changed his ring name to Lenny Lane on the May 24 episode of Saturday Night during a match against Buff Bagwell, which Carlson lost.

Swan joined the Nottingham Forest academy at the age of 13.[5] On 4 January 2020, Swan joined Southern League Premier Division South side Truro City on a one-month loan and scored two goals on his debut at Treyew Road in a 4–0 win over Metropolitan Police later that day.[6] Manager Paul Wotton said that ""he comes from Nottingham Forest with high regard and its a real coup for us"".[7] The loan was extended into a second month and Swan went on to score nine goals in as many games for Truro, before returning to Nottingham on 1 March 2020.[8][9][10]
After scoring eight goals for Forest's U23 side at the start of the season, Swan began training with Forest's first-team.[11] Manager Chris Hughton gave him his debut in professional football on 29 November 2020, putting him on as a 76th-minute substitute during a 1–0 loss to Swansea City at the City Ground.[12] The following month Swan signed a new contract to keep him at the club until 2024.[5] However, his first-team opportunities were limited by the signing of Glenn Murray and return to fitness of Lewis Grabban.[13]
On 1 February 2020, Swan moved on loan to EFL League Two side Port Vale until the end of the 2020–21 season.[14] He scored his first goal in the English Football League on 6 March, during a 3–2 defeat at Cheltenham Town.[15] He played ten matches during his time at Vale Park.[16] He did not play any competitive football during the 2021–22 campaign, though did train with the Forest first-team in March 2022.[17][18] He finished as top-scorer for the under-23 team, scoring 12 goals in 22 appearances as Andy Reid's side reached the semi-finals of the Premier League 2 Division 2 play-offs.[19]

After working two years as trainer for software systems, then eight years in sales and management positions at an insurance company, Struber quit his job to focus on coaching football teams in 2014. He already worked part time as co-trainer in the academy of Red Bull Salzburg from mid-2007 to mid-2010, and as coach of fourth division side SV Kuchl for 20 months. In 2014, Struber started working full time as under-15 coach at the Red Bull Salzburg academy.
Struber became the new manager of Wolfsberger AC for the 2019–20 season. Wolfsberg was ranked in third place after 14 games, same as the season before, and gathered four points out of four games in the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League before Struber left the club.
On 20 November 2019, Struber was appointed as manager of EFL Championship side Barnsley, penning a two-year deal. He succeeded Daniel Stendel.[3][4] Barnsley were bottom of the league, seven points away from safety. They were consigned to the relegation zone for most of the 2019–20 campaign. With two stoppage time wins against Nottingham Forest and Brentford at the end of the season, Struber guided Barnsley to securing Championship football for a second successive season. It was helped by Wigan Athletic falling into administration and getting 12 points deduction. For the 2020–21 season Struber strived to get a stable team, as he did not want to be in the relegation zone again and had ambitious goals for the future of the club.[5]"

The son of a former FC Mulhouse player, also called Néstor and also a striker, Subiat was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and started his career precisely at the French club, as a defender but already showing scoring abilities, which prompted a move up front.[1][2]
After a loan at RC Strasbourg Alsace, Subiat played until 1992 at Mulhouse, scoring a further 25 goals combined as both seasons were spent in Ligue 2. He then moved to Switzerland for the following six years, scoring aplenty for AC Lugano, Grasshopper Club Zürich – even though he only played regularly in his first year – and FC Basel and winning three national championships with the second team.[1]

He did, however, score victories over enhancement talent such as Jim Powers (a five match winning streak in July), Paul Diamond, Mark Young, Jim Evans, and Pez Whatley, and even managed to get a shot[citation needed] at the WWF World Tag Team Titles to wrestle then-champions Demolition alongside Bart's partner for the match, Mark Ming, in a losing effort.
Bart was the opponent for several wrestlers making their debuts in the WWF. On April 24, 1990, Bart was defeated by Dustin Rhodes at a dark match at a Wrestling Challenge taping in San Antonio, Texas. This was Dustin's debut. On the July 21 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Bart teamed with Tom Stone to face The Legion of Doom in their first match with the company. On July 24, 1990, he was defeated by Shane Douglas at a house show in Los Angeles, California. Following a series of matches in July against Jim Powers where Powers emerged victorious in every encounter, he entered a house show series in August with Pez Whatley. He then moved on a to another house show program – this time with the former Killer Bee Jim Brunzell. Brunzell would win all of these encounters. In October Bart would enter a house show series with Dustin Rhodes and again would come up winless. That winter he began a series of matches with Saba Simba and Shane Douglas, coming up winless in all of those encounters."

Sturgess enjoys playing many other sports and before concentrating on basketball also played golf and football.[8] He started playing team basketball at age 14 when he was 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m), was 7 ft (2.1 m) aged 16 playing at Burleigh Community College, and was 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) when he graduated high school at age 18. A growth spurt during ages of 16 and 17 resulted in a 1 ft (30 cm) of height added within a single year. Sturgess can hold the 10 ft (3.0 m) high rim whilst standing. He declined offers to play professional basketball in Europe, preferring to pursue basketball in the US.
Later Sturgess transferred back to the Harlem Globetrotters act, this time being part of the arranged opposition.[12] In the re-formed Washington Generals Sturgess adopted a mask and the pseudonym of ""Cager,"" adopting a villainous role.[13]"

In 2013, she qualified for the World Judo Championships held in Brazil. However, she never competed in the competition, leaving to find help, eventually seeking asylum and remaining in the country.[2] In Brazil she started training at the Instituto Reação, a judo school founded by Olympic bronze medallist Flávio Canto and now trains under coach Geraldo Bernardes in Rio de Janeiro.[1][2][3] Before joining Reação in 2015, Mabika even slept on the street, and worked as a sweeper and at a textile mill.[6] She received support and funding from the IOC's Olympic Solidarity programme.[3]"

In 2005, the Mountaineers defense ranked 15th in the nation in total defense and 13th in points allowed under Casteel. In 2006, the Mountaineers pass defense ranked #109 out of the nation, 119 teams. The next season, 2007, the acquisitions of safety Ryan Mundy and freshman defensive backs helped the Mountaineer defense to a top 10 defensive ranking.[2] His 2007 defense also ranked in the top 30 in eight categories. The Mountaineers finished seventh in the nation in total defense, eighth in scoring defense and 14th in pass efficiency defense. Following the season, Casteel was named the Defensive Coordinator of the Year by Rivals.com.[3]

He came through the World Championship Qualifiers to make his PDC World Darts Championship debut in 2005,[8] losing 3–0 in the first round to Mark Holden.[9] Wade bounced back from this to win the Irish Masters and moved closer to the top 32 in the world for the first time.[2] He lost 11–4 to Peter Manley in the last 16 of the UK Open and 3–1 against Roland Scholten in the last 16 of the Las Vegas Desert Classic (after beating the experienced Ronnie Baxter in the prior round).[10][11] In his second World Championship appearance he lost again in the first round, this time 3–2 to Wayne Jones, despite having won the first six legs for a two-set lead.[2]

Wade hit two nine-dart finishes in the early part of 2006, but when he was defeated in the qualifiers for the Las Vegas Desert Classic he decided to give up his job as a mechanic and become a full-time darts professional.[2]
The results of this were evident almost immediately as he made his major breakthrough on television during the 2006 World Matchplay in July. He sensationally reached the final, seeing off four experienced players in his first ever appearance at the Winter Gardens. Wade beat Denis Ovens in the first round 10–1, having had darts to make it a 10–0 whitewash, 2004 World Championship finalist Kevin Painter 13–9 in the second round, ending one leg with two double 20's to cause a minor controversy, and beat Chris Mason 16–4 in his quarter-final. In the semi-finals he came back from 1–5 down to beat Roland Scholten 19–17 in extra legs, as a player is required to win the match by two clear legs in the Matchplay. In the final he played Phil Taylor but despite being 8–5 up, he lost 18–11.[12][13]
In the rest of 2006 in the non-televised events he reached three semi-finals and a final, before he won the Vauxhall Men's Singles by defeating Ronnie Baxter 5–3 in the final, having hit his third nine-darter of the year in the semi-finals of the event.[14]
Wade won his first matches in the PDC World Championship in 2007 by beating Warren French and Dave Ladley to reach the last 16, where Terry Jenkins was a 4–3 victor.[15] He was then awarded with the PDC's Young Player of the Year and his world ranking had climbed to number 11.[2]
He then returned to Blackpool for the World Matchplay and claimed the title – his first major televised tournament success and became the youngest player ever to win a PDC televised event in doing so.[16] His route to the title and £50,000 cheque saw him beat Wayne Jones, Dennis Priestley, Mervyn King, Adrian Lewis and Terry Jenkins in the final.[17]
Although Wade's victory was nothing short of emphatic over the ever-tenacious Jenkins, many believe his semi-final victory over Lewis was one of the finest performances ever seen at the Winter Gardens. Both players averaged 101, but it was Wade's finishing, as he checked out almost 70% of his doubles, which saw him triumph 17–7.[18] His 18–7 win over Jenkins in the final saw him move up to world number three.[19]
Wade also won the next PDC major tournament – the World Grand Prix in Dublin in October beating van Barneveld by 5 sets to 1 in the semi-finals and once again denying Jenkins his first major title in the final by winning 6–3.[20]
These successes saw Wade being crowned the 2007 PDC Player of the Year and PDPA Players' Player of the Year.[2]
At the 2008 World Championship Wade reached the quarter-finals and was defeated 5 sets to 4 in a close encounter against John Part, who went on to win the tournament.[21]
Wade made his debut in the Premier League as he was in the top four of the Order of Merit and on the opening night became the first player to defeat Taylor in the tournament's three-year history, winning the match 8 legs to 6. Taylor however exacted revenge with a 16–8 victory in the final on 26 May 2008 after Wade had defeated van Barneveld in the semi-finals.[2] Incredibly, Wade claimed his third major title in a year at the UK Open, by beating American Gary Mawson 11–7 in the final.[22] The following month, he reached the finals of the Las Vegas Desert Classic, losing 13–7 to Taylor.[23] Then in July he reached his third World Matchplay final in a row, losing for the second time in three years in the final to Taylor 18–9, making this the third major final loss of the year against Taylor.[24] In the defence of his World Grand Prix title he lost to Tony Eccles in the first round.[25] He returned to form to claim two Players Championship titles in the autumn and also hit his first televised nine-darter in a second round loss to Gary Anderson at the Grand Slam of Darts.[2]
In the 2009 World Championship, Wade went a stage further than the previous year, reaching the semi-finals where he lost 4–6 to Raymond van Barneveld.[26]
Wade won the 2009 Premier League Darts tournament, defeating Mervyn King 13–8 at the Wembley Arena. However, he failed to defend his UK Open title in 2009 after losing to Peter Manley 9–8 in the third round. He then failed to reach the World Matchplay final for the first time, losing in the quarter-finals to Ronnie Baxter.
Wade won the 2010 World Grand Prix, beating Adrian Lewis 6–3 in the final. Four days later, he won his second major tournament inside a week by defeating Taylor 6–5 in the 2010 Championship League Darts final.
Wade reached another major final in 2010 at the Grand Slam, seeing both Mervyn King and Terry Jenkins squander match darts against him before Wade himself threw away an 8–0 lead against BDO player Scott Waites in the final, as Waites came back to win 16–12.

Wade was the number two seed for the 2011 World Championship due to his World Grand Prix and Champions League Darts victories. However, Wade was beaten by world number 47 Mensur Suljović 4–2 in the second round. He got off to a poor start in the Premier League of Darts losing 8–3 to an on form Mark Webster he went on to defeat World Champion Adrian Lewis 8–6 in week 2 and then lost 8–5 to Simon Whitlock; during the match he took some stick from the Belfast crowd.[27]
He regained some form in the latter weeks of the League drawing with Raymond Van Barneveld 7–7 while averaging over 100.[28]
In June he won his 7th major title 2011 UK Open Darts after an 11–8 win against Wes Newton.[29] At the 2011 World Matchplay, he reached his fourth final and third against Phil Taylor. Wade beat Raymond van Barneveld and Adrian Lewis en route, before losing to Taylor in the final 18–8.
Wade dropped just one set to reach the quarter-finals of the 2012 World Championship, but was then involved in two of the best games ever witnessed at the event.[30] He played John Part in the last 8 and raced into a 3–1 lead before the Canadian won three sets in a row. Wade took the game into a deciding set and the players broke each other's throws twice to require a sudden-death leg, which he managed to win by taking out 85 with Part on 40.[31] He played defending champion Adrian Lewis in the semi-finals and looked to be heading for his first PDC World final as he led 5–1. Lewis pulled a set back, before Wade had a dart at double 18 to win the match. He missed and it proved to be a pivotal moment as Lewis took the set and reeled off 10 straight legs to complete a sensational comeback 5–6. Despite the loss, Wade moved up to third in the PDC Order of Merit overtaking Gary Anderson.[32]
Wade beat Richie Burnett, Mark Walsh, Michael van Gerwen and Terry Jenkins to reach his fifth World Matchplay final and his fourth against Phil Taylor.[38][39] Wade trailed 10–14, but hit back to 14–15 and then missed a dart at double 10 to level the game. He went on to lose 15–18, stating after the match that winning 15 legs against Taylor whilst playing ""half-mast"" was a good achievement and that he had never felt so happy playing darts.[40] However, during his first round defeat to Colin Osborne in the World Grand Prix, Wade appeared visibly unsettled and immediately flew back home to receive treatment for bipolar disorder, with which he was diagnosed in 2010.[41] He released a statement to thank fans for their support and did not play again until the Grand Slam of Darts,[42] where he finished third in his group following one win and two defeats.[43] After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Wade finished 12th on the Order of Merit to qualify for the Players Championship Finals.[44] He lost to Brendan Dolan 4–6 in the first round.[45]

At the 2013 World Championship, Wade beat Peter Hudson 3–0, Steve Beaton 4–2 and Vincent van der Voort 4–0 and then edged past Wes Newton 5–4 in the quarter-finals.[46] He was 1–3 down to Michael van Gerwen in the semi-finals, who then hit a nine dart finish and was a double 12 away from becoming the first player to hit successive perfect legs. However, Wade won the set and then levelled the game at 3–3. Despite averaging 10 points lower than his opponent, which included hitting one 180 to van Gerwen's 14, Wade stayed in the match by taking out finishes at crucial times. But the pressure exerted on Wade eventually showed as he lost 4–6.[47] Wade's best performance of the league stage of the Premier League came in week five when he averaged 105.73 during a 7–1 win over Robert Thornton, who had not lost any of his first four matches.[48] Despite losing three matches in a row he went into the final night needing a positive result against Phil Taylor to qualify for the play-offs.[49] He managed a 6–6 draw and after other results were favourable for Wade he finished fourth in the league to play van Gerwen in the semi-finals, who he had beaten 7–4 and lost to 5–7 during the league campaign.[49] Wade uncharacteristically missed a plethora of darts at doubles, hitting just 20% during the match and, despite a brief fightback from 2–7 down, he would lose 4–8.[50]
On 20 August, Wade was banned by the PDC for four tournaments regarding his behavior at recent Pro Tour events.

Wade was free to return at the German Darts Masters in September.[55] In October Wade reached the semi-finals of the World Grand Prix, where he lost 5–1 to Phil Taylor, extending his winless run against Taylor to 18 matches. Taylor remarked afterwards: ""James didn't click. He was gone. It's the first time I've ever seen him gone. He told me afterwards that he just gave up.""[56] At the inaugural Masters Wade fought a partisan crowd to come back from 7–4 behind in the quarter-finals against Simon Whitlock to finish 91 on the bullseye in the deciding leg to win 8–7.[57] Wade, whose ranking has now dropped to world number six, stated that he wanted to prove that he should be back in the top four.[57] Early on in the semi-final his opponent Taylor threw a broken flight from the stage, with Wade then asking for it back before complaining to match officials. Wade asked the referee to forfeit the match and lost 10–1 with an average of 73.99.[58] Wade returned to win all three of his group games at the Grand Slam of Darts and then cruised past Paul Nicholson 10–1 to face Taylor yet again.[59] The meeting looked to be heading in a similar manner to Wade's recent heavy defeats as he trailed 9–2, but he then won five unanswered legs before missing three darts to reduce his deficit to only one. This was as close as he could get to Taylor and he went on to lose 16–12.[60]

Wade rode his luck at the 2014 World Championship as Darren Webster missed six match darts in the first round and Andy Smith missed two in the second.[61][62] Nevertheless, Wade advanced to the quarter-finals but was comfortably beaten 5–1 by Adrian Lewis as he missed 34 darts at doubles during the match.[63] As he was outside the top four on the Order of Merit, Wade had no guarantee he would be involved in the 2014 Premier League and he did not receive a wildcard from the PDC or Sky Sports which saw him miss the event for the first time since 2007. PDC chairman Barry Hearn explained the decision was made to give Wade a rest to enable him more time to gain treatment for his health issues,[64] but Wade released a statement the following day, describing the omission as ""devastating"" as he was ""one of the four most consistent players in 2013"".[65] Wade also said he didn't ask to be left out and didn't decline an invitation, and that, with regards the reason given by Hearn that he could gain treatment for his bipolar disorder, ""no medical professional has suggested I take a break"".[65]

Albom's fifth novel, The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto, was published by HarperCollins in 2015. His longest book at almost 400 pages, it chronicles the life and mysterious death of the fictional musician Frankie Presto, as narrated by the voice of Music. An orphan born in a burning church in Spain in 1936, Frankie is blessed with musical ability: at nine years old, Frankie is sent to America in the bottom of a boat, his only possession is an old guitar and six precious strings. The Forrest Gump-like journey that follows takes him through the musical landscape of the 20th century, from classical to jazz to rock and roll super stardom, meeting and working with musical greats (like Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Carole King, Little Richard, and The Beatles). Real musicians including Tony Bennett, Wynton Marsalis, Paul Stanley, Darlene Love, and Ingrid Michaelson, lent their names to first-person passages to the book,[citation needed] and an original 17-song soundtrack for the book was released by Republic Records four days before the book's release. It featured original songs written and performed by Albom and other artists including Sawyer Fredericks, Mat Kearney, Ingrid Michaelson, John Pizzarelli, and James Brent, interpreting Frankie Presto's ""greatest hits"", along with such older favorites featured in the novel such as Tony Bennett's ""Lost in the Stars"" and Dionne Warwick's ""A House is Not a Home.""[27]
The Little Liar was published on November 14, 2023, by HarperCollins.[35] The book peaked at #5 on the New York Times Best Sellers list on December 3, 2023.[36] The book is historical fiction following Nico, an eleven-year-old boy during the Germany's occupation of Greece in World War II.[37]

These views were upheld in 2006 when Archbishop Martin of Dublin called on the state to consider alternative patrons for schools[4] and in 2011 when Ruairí Quinn, Minister for Education and Skills, established a special commission to examine how some schools could be transferred from the patronage of the Catholic Church to other bodies.[5]
In 2003, he was awarded a research grant to examine homophobic bullying in Irish second-level schools. Between 2004 and 2008 he published several reports and two books revealing the extent of the issue in Ireland.[6] In 2005 he became an associate professor at the School of Education Studies in Dublin City University where his research led to the launch in October 2006 of the ""Making Our Schools Safe"" campaign by the Department of Education and Science.[7] His work on bullying also informed debate in Dáil Éireann[8] and was quoted in a session of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education.[9] In May 2012 he was invited to participate in the National Anti-Bullying Forum sponsored by the Government of Ireland at the Department of Education and Skills.
He also extended his work on bullying to include research on cyberbullying,[10] and his research on bullying and education was published in journals including the British Journal of Educational Management, Administration and Leadership.
In 2010 he co-edited the International Handbook on Education for Spirituality, Care and Wellbeing (Netherlands: Springer). In addition to his publications he has also been consulted and deposed on issues related to equality and education.[11] In 2012 he was awarded a research scholarship funded by the US State Department which allowed him to participate in research on alternatives to political violence in Boston College’s Irish Institute.[12]
As an academic at DCU he has contributed to education debates and has been consulted by the media as a spokesperson on educational and social issues.[15][16][17][18][19][20]

Vergniory studied the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database to identify topologically nontrivial materials.[12] She designed a computational effort to simulate real materials and determine whether or not they showed topological properties.[13] This included complex theoretical analysis that could classify topological phases, and information from materials scientists on whether materials were suitable or not.[14] Vergniory uses her supercomputers to perform her calculations ab initio.[6] In an interview with Physics World, Verginory said that she had been surprised by how many materials she identified with topological properties.[14] As an output of this work, the high-order topological insulator Bi4Br4 was synthesised and studied experimentally. She showed that if it was possible to identify the symmetry of the crystalline symmetry of a material, she could easily anticipate the behaviour of the charge.[14] She has since started investigating organic materials.[14] She believes that topological crystals with a chiral structure will display several exotic physical phenomena.[15]"

A native of South Pasadena, California, she graduated from  Harvard College and Yale Law School. Kruger then clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, and subsequently worked in private practice and as a professor. She served as acting Principal Deputy Solicitor General of the United States from 2010 to 2011, and worked in the Office of Legal Counsel. In 2014, California Governor Jerry Brown nominated Kruger to a seat on the Supreme Court of California. She was confirmed, and was sworn in on January 5, 2015.
Born in Glendale, California,[1][5] Kruger grew up in South Pasadena.[6] Her mother, Audrey Reid, immigrated to the United States from Jamaica,[7] and her late father, Leon Kruger, was an American Jew whose parents had immigrated to the U.S. from Europe.[8] Kruger's parents were both pediatricians.[9] She attended Polytechnic School in Pasadena, California, and was a National Merit Scholar.[5][10]
She then earned a Bachelor of Arts degree magna cum laude from Harvard University, where she wrote for The Harvard Crimson and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[11][12][13] She then attended Yale Law School, graduating in 2001 with a Juris Doctor. Kruger was editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal, the first Black woman ever to hold the position.[14][15]
On November 24, 2014, then Governor Jerry Brown announced the appointment of Kruger to the California Supreme Court.[5]  On her questionnaire for the high court position, Kruger acknowledged she had never before taken a deposition and that, “I have not tried any cases to verdict or judgment.”[21] Although she had no prior judicial experience, her selection was publicly praised by then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Obama's then-U.S. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., Obama's former Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal, and former Solicitor General (under President George W. Bush) Paul Clement.[22]
After President Joe Biden made a campaign pledge to appoint the first African American woman to the United States Supreme Court, Kruger became the subject of speculation as a potential future nominee (Ketanji Brown Jackson was ultimately nominated to the seat).[3] If she had been nominated to replace Justice Stephen Breyer, she would have continued the tradition of the court's ""Jewish seat."" While Justice Elena Kagan is also Jewish, Breyer sits in a seat historically assigned to a Jew for a large part of the past 100 years. The seat was held by Benjamin Cardozo, Felix Frankfurter, Arthur Goldberg, Abe Fortas, and Breyer, but also was occupied from 1970 to 1994 by the Methodist Harry Blackmun.[44][45]"

She has released seven critically-acclaimed studio albums.
Martha was born in New York City on May 8, 1976, to folk musicians Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III. She moved to Montreal with her mother and brother when she was one year old, and was raised in Montreal in a musical family. She is Rufus Wainwright's sister and they frequently perform together and collaborate on each other’s albums. Martha is also half-sister to Lucy Wainwright Roche, with whom she collaborated on the album Songs In The Dark, which was nominated for a Juno Award.
""Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole"" was used at the end of the second episode in season three of the Netflix original series Orange is the New Black, and at the end of the fourth episode in season one of the HBO original series Big Little Lies.
Wainwright's second album, I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too, was released through Zoë Records and Drowned in Sound in June 2008, resulting in the No. 10 position on the Top Heatseekers Billboard charts and No. 6 on the Billboard Canada Music Charts, among other chart positions throughout Europe and Australia. The album was hailed for showcasing Wainwright's musical maturity and talent as a songwriter, and was a Long List Nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize.[12] The album features 12 original tracks and cover versions of Pink Floyd's See Emily Play and, as a bonus track in some countries, the Eurythmics' Love Is a Stranger. The Australian release included a limited edition digipak with additional images and the bonus track. ""Comin' Tonight"" was released as an iTunes exclusive download in Australia in April 2008.
Come Home To Mama was released on October 15, 2012. The album was recorded at Sean Lennon's home studio in New York City and produced by Cibo Matto’s Yuka Honda. Guest musicians on the album included Honda, Lennon, Wilco guitarist Nels Cline, and Dirty Three drummer Jim White. ""Proserpina"", the album's first single, was written by Wainwright's mother, Kate McGarrigle, who died in 2010. Produced by Cibo Matto’s Yuka Honda, it was heralded by Mojo Magazine as a ""substantial and brilliantly sung career best."" The album peaked at #6 on the Billboard Canada Music Charts and #21 US Top Heatseekers Billboard charts.[7] The song ""Four Black Sheep"" was originally recorded in 2009 for CBC Radio 2's Great Canadian Song Quest.
In 2021, Wainwright released Love Will Be Reborn, which has been received as her best album since her self-titled debut.[23] Love Will Be Reborn was made during the pandemic and recorded in Wainwright's hometown of Montreal, in the basement of her café-bar, Ursa, which also served as a studio. The songs on the album were largely influenced by her divorce from producer Brad Albetta.[24] Wainwright began writing the album in 2017 after her separation from Albetta. Wainwright has described the album as ""more on a broader perspective of themes of life and death, and time and trust and lack of trust, and parenthood and all of these things that sort of seem like a much bigger, broader, perspective and a deeper, more layered life.""[25]
The album features Toronto musicians Thom Gill, Phil Melanson, Morgan Moore, and Josh Cole of Bernice, and was produced by Pierre Marchand, who also produced several of Kate & Anna McGarrigle's albums. Love Will Be Reborn received universal acclaim upon its release. Pitchfork wrote that, ""Love Will Be Reborn feels at once bigger and smaller than her previous material, with each quiet rumination leading her toward grander musings on love, grief, and motherhood.[23]"" American Songwriter wrote that Love Will Be Reborn ""could be considered Martha Wainwright’s tour de force, a de facto declaration of outrage and emotion shared with full intent and without hesitation,"" and hailed that ""if artistry is the product of passion, then Wainwright has demonstrated yet again that she's capable of channeling it better than most.[26]""
In 2019, Wainwright opened a café-bar in Montreal called Ursa on Parc Avenue. Several artists have performed at the venue since it opened, including Patrick Watson, La Force, The Barr Brothers, Rufus Wainwright, and Loudon Wainwright III. Her 2021 album, Love Will Be Reborn, was recorded at Ursa during the COVID-19 pandemic."

After winning three consecutive National Championships and going 43–2 since 2011, the expectations for the 2014 team were not high. The Bison had lost their starting quarterback and a total of 30 seniors who graduated before the season started. But 2014 surprised everyone when he and future 2nd overall NFL draft pick Carson Wentz led the Bison to a 15–1 overall record and a fourth consecutive national championship by beating Illinois State in a close, hard-fought championship game. NDSU became the first Division 1 football program to win four consecutive championships.

He managed Eccleshall during 2020.
Born in Wellington, Telford, Shropshire, Proudlock began his career as a trainee with Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 1998. He had a loan spell at Scottish side Clyde at the start of the 2000–01 season to gain first team experience. There, he scored a hat trick on his professional debut on 5 August 2000 against last seasons Scottish 1st Division champions Falkirk in a 3–1 win at Broadwood.[2] He scored five times in six games for Clyde and was named Scottish Division One player of the month for August 2000.[3] He was recalled by Wolves and offered a new contract until 2003.[3] He became a regular starter for Wolves throughout that season, which he ended as their top goalscorer with 11 goals.
Proudlock found himself mostly relegated to the substitutes bench in the 2001–02 season after manager Dave Jones spent heavily in the close season on new attacking players. He scored a hat trick against Bradford City in October 2001, which earned praise from Jones,[4] but these ended up his only goals of the season. A knee injury suffered in December 2001 that required surgery interrupted his season,[5] a four-match suspension followed and having missed a lot of football, he joined Nottingham Forest on a one-month loan in March 2002.[6]
Opportunities were limited at Molineux and Proudlock joined Tranmere on loan in October 2002[7] and Sheffield Wednesday on loan in December 2002, where he scored twice in five matches.[8] He was recalled by Wolves in January 2003 and made a total of 22 appearances, almost all as substitute,[9] for Wolves in the 2002–03 season as Wolves were promoted to the Premier League after beating Sheffield United in the Division One play-off final in May 2003.[10] In total, he scored 17 goals for Wolves in 84 appearances.[11]

Proudlock was released from the Portman Road club at the end of the 2005–06 campaign.
Proudlock joined Stockport County on non-contract terms in August 2006.[19] He agreed a permanent deal to the end of the 2007–08 season with Stockport in December 2006,[20] and made 26 league and cup appearances for Stockport in the 2006–07 season, scoring six goals. The following season, he scored ten goals as Stockport reached and won the League Two play-off final at Wembley Stadium in May 2008. However, a week later he was released by the club as his contract expired,[21]
On 6 November 2008 Proudlock joined Grimsby Town on an initial two-month loan with a view to a permanent move.
He made his debut in the FA Cup defeat to Morecambe. He managed to score his first goal for the club in a 2–1 away defeat against Port Vale, and after impressing manager Mike Newell in his loan stay, Proudlock was reported to be a target for the club in the January transfer window. Adam made his move to Grimsby a permanent one by signing for the club until the end of the 2010–11 season in January 2009. His strike partnership with fellow newcomer Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro resulted in Adam scoring a hat-trick against local rivals Lincoln City in a 5–1 victory on 7 March 2009. Following the arrival of loan striker Barry Conlon, Proudlock found himself playing second fiddle to him and Akpa-Akpro in the remaining games of the season, but his goals and performances were a great help in helping the club eventually stave off relegation from the Football League. Adam finished the 2008–09 season as the club's top goalscorer, with a total of 8.
In July 2010 Proudlock began training with Hungarian side Ferencváros[24] before being offered the chance of playing for Non League side Bridgnorth Town[25] as well as receiving an offer from Stafford Rangers but instead Adam chose to join Kidderminster Harriers on trial[26] After failing to impress the Harriers management he joined Andy Sinton's A.F.C. Telford United on trial and played in the club's friendly against Chasetown.[27] He subsequently signed a short-term contract with the Bucks. In his first season, he helped the club to promotion from the Conference North, but soon suffered an injury that sidelined him for the majority of the 2011–12 season. He rejected a fresh contract at Telford in June 2012 as it involved reduced terms and a pay as you play deal.[28]
On 14 June 2012 Proudlock joined Conference North side Chester[29] but left the club in September after his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.
After his release from Chester he then joined Market Drayton Town on a game-by game deal in October 2012.[30] In December 2012 Proudlock moved on loan to his home town side Newport Town of the West Midlands Division Two[31]
In July 2013 Proudlock signed for Whitehawk on non-contract terms, making his debut in the club's friendly with Crawley Town.[32] He however left the club in August 2013 having been snubbed a further deal.
Proudlock coaches youngsters for both DoubleTouch coaching and with the youth setup at Newport Town.[34]
On Tuesday 1 May 2018 Proudlock won his first trophy as a manager, the Shropshire Premier Cup as he led his Newport Town side to a 3–1 win over Haughmond, a team two divisions higher. In June 2020 Proudlock was appointed manager of Eccleshall F.C.[35] He left the club at the end of October.[36]"

He previously served as vice president under his predecessor, France-Albert René, from 1996 to 2004.[1]
James Alix Michel, GCSK  (born 16 August 1944) is a Seychellois politician who served as the third President of Seychelles from 2004 to 2016. He previously served as vice president under his predecessor, France-Albert René, from 1996 to 2004.[1]
Michel followed President René through different political posts during all periods of the Seychelles' history as an independent entity. He was a member of the executive committee of the Seychelles People's United Party from 1974 to 1977; subsequently, when the party was transformed into the Seychelles People's Progressive Front (SPPF), he became a member of its Central Executive Committee. René staged a coup against the country's first President, James Mancham, only one year after independence, and Michel was appointed Minister of Public Administration and Information in June 1977. During the 1979–1991 one-party socialist rule, Michel held various ruling party and ministerial portfolios, such as Minister of Finance from 1989 to 2006.[2][3][4] In 1984 he became the SPPF's Deputy Secretary-General, and in 1994 he became its secretary-general.[5]
During the rule of President René, Michel held positions with a significant role Seychellois economic policy on several occasions. In these 27 years, the Seychelles experienced a period of economic growth based on its tourism and fishery sectors, which was followed by stagnation in the 1990s. Beginning in 2008, around the time of the Great Recession Michel had presided over a program of macroeconomic reforms in a neoliberal direction, featuring a massive reduction in public budget deficit (‘austerity measures’) and a complete liberalization of foreign exchange transactions.
Michel played a major potlical role in the country's democratisation process, importantlynwith the  return of multi-party elections in 1993. However, potlical opponents have maintained Seychelles still suffers from limited freedom and transparency of the press, even raising claims of rigged elections. International observers present during Seychellois elections held since 1993 had declared them to have been “free and fair”.[6] According to official results, President René and his Seychelles People's Progressive Front party won presidential and legislative elections in 2001 and 2002 respectively, with about 54% of the vote in both cases.[7]
After serving as vice-president for nearly eight years, beginning in August 1996, Michel became president on 14 July 2004, when René stepped down. At that point, Michel was René's longest-serving cabinet minister. As President, he held the portfolios of Defence, Police, Information, and Risk & Disaster Management.[5]
Seychelles' opposition leader, Wavel Ramkalawan, expressed increased concern over the declining trends in the national economy and demanded more dialogue with the ruling party. The leader of the Seychelles National Party furthermore said that he would be cooperating with President Michel.
Michel won the presidential election held on 28–30 July 2006, taking 53.7% of the vote. He was sworn in for his new term on 1 August 2006.[9] Michel won re-election in May 2011, receiving 55.4% of the vote. He was sworn in for his new term of office on 22 May 2011.
In early 2015, Michel confirmed that he planned to run for a third term in the next presidential election. Reflecting on his time in office, he said: ""I worked hard, I did everything for Seychelles [and] the Seychellois people and I feel that people appreciate my work.""[10] His term was scheduled to end in 2016, but he announced on 1 October 2015 that the next election would be held a few months earlier. The date was subsequently set for 3–5 December 2015.[11] He very narrowly defeated Ramkalawan in a run-off by a margin of less than 200 votes.[12]
Michel announced on 27 September 2016 that he was resigning, effective 16 October, and handing over power to Vice President Danny Faure, less than a year into his third term.[13] The decision coincided with the election of an opposition majority in the National Assembly in the September 2016 parliamentary election. Michel said that ""a new generation of Parti Lepep will take Seychelles to the next frontier of its development"" and that he felt ""a sense of mission accomplished"".[14]"

He began his career as a leg-break and googly bowler, but later switched to medium-pace. In 112 first-class appearances, he took nearly 230 wickets.
Castell was born at Oxford in August 1943. He first came to the attention of Hampshire coach Arthur Holt as a leg break googly bowler while playing for an Oxford juniors team in 1959,[1] who invited Castell to join the Hampshire staff without a trial.[2][3] Early in his career at Hampshire, he built a good relationship with Hampshire secretary Desmond Eagar, who once chastised him for the casual manner in which he addressed Hampshire president Harry Altham.[2]
He played infrequently for Hampshire in 1964 and 1965, failing to live up to the early promise his leg break bowling had shown; the Australian Bill Alley had suggested that Castell was more promising than Richie Benaud was at the same age.[3] He reinvented himself as a right-arm medium pace bowling ahead of the 1966 season, in which he made eleven first-class appearances,[4] taking 36 wickets at an average of 22.55, which included two five wicket hauls and what were, at that point, his career best bowling figures of 6 for 49.[7] In that same season, he also made his debut in List A one-day cricket against Worcestershire in the semi-final of the Gillette Cup.[9] Over the following two seasons, he was largely ineffective, taking 12 and 19 wickets respectively in 1967 and 1968, at expensive averages.[7] He made 22 first-class appearances in 1969,[4] having his most successful season in terms of wickets, with 50 at an average of 25.90; amongst his three five wickets hauls that season were his career best figures of 6 for 22,[7] taken against Somerset.[10]"

Met with critical and commercial success, the album peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200, although it served as his only major label release for Def Jam Recordings; he thereafter released seven albums independently to continued critical praise. While doing so, he performed as a member of the hip hop supergroup Slaughterhouse, which were signed to Eminem's Shady Records in 2012; the group released two studio albums.[3][4]

Walter John Downes (born 9 June 1961) is an English professional football manager and former player who played as a midfielder.[3] He was most recently manager of AFC Wimbledon.
As a footballer, Downes played the majority of his career for Wimbledon as well as shorter spells with Newport County, Sheffield United and Hayes. He was the manager of Brentford between 2002 and 2004.
Downes was born in Hammersmith, London.[1] He is the nephew of former world middleweight boxing champion Terry Downes.[4]
Downes started out as an apprentice with Wimbledon and was their first ever full-time Football League apprentice.[5] He is often cited as being the main instigator of the Crazy Gang spirit at the club,[6] as it rose from the Fourth to the First Division inside a decade. In 1979, aged 17 he scored on his league debut against Barnsley and went on to make over 200 appearances for Wimbledon, usually as a midfielder.[5]
In 1988, he left to join his mentor and former Wimbledon manager Dave Bassett at Sheffield United, but his career for his new club was severely limited by a number of serious injuries, and also by a poor disciplinary record, getting sent off twice in his nine appearances.

Following four broken legs he retired through injury.[5] Downes took a coaching position at Crystal Palace, and spent 12 years at Selhurst Park, most of these under Steve Coppell.
Following four broken legs he retired through injury.[5] Downes took a coaching position at Crystal Palace, and spent 12 years at Selhurst Park, most of these under Steve Coppell.
Downes then once again rejoined Coppell, this time at Reading, initially on a casual basis, but quickly proved himself invaluable, and took on the job of coaching Reading's defence. As a result, Downes was a major reason for Reading's impressive defensive display in the 2005–06 Championship season, where Reading had the best defensive statistics in the entire English football pyramid, and were promoted to the Premier League with a record 106 points.
In January 2007, Downes was involved in a touchline scuffle with Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock after he accused Warnock of telling his players to 'break legs'. However Warnock said: ""I made the kicking gesture to tell the referee that Steve Sidwell's tackle on Chris Armstrong had been the worst of the game. Fortunately for me, the referee heard exactly what was said and confirmed that."" Downes was charged with improper conduct for his role in the affray.[7]
On 14 May 2009, the club announced that they wouldn't renew his and Kevin Dillon's contract after Reading failed to bounce back to the Premier League at the first attempt after getting knocked out of the play-offs by Burnley 3–0 on aggregate and the departure of Steve Coppell. This was officially announced on the day of Steve Coppell's press conference.[citation needed]
On 7 September 2009, Downes was appointed to a position within the backroom staff of League 1 club, Southampton. He was dismissed along with Alan Pardew on 30 August 2010.[8]

For a few weeks in October and November 2010 Downes was hired as a part-time defensive coach for League Two side Gillingham. Then on 24 November 2010, Downes was appointed as a defensive coach at West Ham United under manager Avram Grant. His appointment came a day after the West Ham board sacked assistant manager Zeljko Petrovic.[9] In May 2011, shortly after West Ham were relegated from the Premier League, Grant was sacked however Downes kept his job and was named first team coach when new manager Sam Allardyce took over.[10] On 11 December 2012 Downes' departure from his role with West Ham United was announced.[11]  He went on to spend some time working under Harry Redknapp at Queens Park Rangers.[12]

Prior to the 2017–18 Indian Super League season, Downes joined Steve Coppell at Jamshedpur.[13] He subsequently coached at other Indian clubs, Kerala Blasters[14] and ATK.[15]
Downes left Crystal Palace in 2000 and joined Brentford as assistant manager.[16] After Ron Noades stepped down as manager, he carried on in the role under Ray Lewington and Steve Coppell.[16] When Coppell left Brentford in June 2002, Downes was appointed manager.[16] He had an unbeaten start to his reign in August 2002, winning the Division Two Manager of the Month award.[17] Downes led the club to 16th position in the Second Division in 2002–03, but was sacked in March 2004 after a run of poor results and the club near the bottom of the table and facing relegation.[18]
On 4 December 2018, Downes took over after Neal Ardley had left the club by mutual consent.[19] His assistant manager was fellow former Wimbledon FC midfielder Glyn Hodges.[20] When Downes was appointed, Wimbledon were six points from avoiding relegation from League One. They had slipped further behind to be nine points below 20th place in early March. Under Downes they won 21 points from their last 12 matches and successfully avoided relegation on the final day of the season.[21]

On 25 September 2019 he was suspended from his duties by the club after being charged by the FA for misconduct under FA Rule E1(b), in respect of eight small bets placed on various football matches in a period between 30 November 2013 and 12 July 2019.[22][23] In October, the FA issued Downes with a fine of £3,000 and banned him from football for four weeks after he admitted the offences.[24] Two days later, he and the club parted company.[25]

He lived in Rome, and then Turin, later becoming an Italian citizen.[1] He started his professional career with Serie C2 side Casale, 60 km from Turin. He also played for Torino Berretti[2] and Primavera Team,[3] before being released in June 2005 after the old Torino went bankrupt. After the relegation of Casale, he joined Serie C2 side Portogruaro Summaga[1] but soon returned to Casale in Serie D. In the 2007–08 season, he left for another Piedmont club, Novara, but failed to play regularly in Serie C1. In January 2008, he left for a short spell with Serie C1 club Pescara. In July 2008, he joined Canavese.[4] He scored 11 goals for Canavese in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.
In July 2009, he was signed by Varese along with fellow countrymen Wilfred Osuji and Kingsley Umunegbu. His first season with the club eventually proved to be very successful. Ebagua went on to make 27 league appearances and scoring 12 goals, contributing to the return of Varese to Serie B for this first time in 25 years.[5] Following a successful first season with the club, Ebagua continued his goal scoring displays in the 2010–11 Serie B campaign as he would help guide the club to a promotion play-off spot with his 12 goals in 30 matches. Varese eventually lost in their quest for two-consecutive promotions, and Ebagua was eventually sold to Serie B rivals Torino F.C. in co-ownership deal for €1.2 million cash plus half of Gaetano Carrieri in June 2011.[6]
In his first five months with his new club, Ebagua failed to replicate his form from Varese, and managed just 3 goals in 20 league appearances. He was subsequently loaned out in the 2012 winter transfer window following the arrival of Cristian Pasquato from Juventus.
On 31 January 2012, he officially joined Serie A side Catania on loan from Torino for the rest of the season. The club was looking to add depth to their front line following the departure of Maxi López to Milan."
