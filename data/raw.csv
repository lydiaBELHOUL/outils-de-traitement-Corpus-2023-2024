Patrick Seale, Abu Nidal\'s biographer, wrote of the shootings that their ""random cruelty marked them as typical Abu Nidal operations"".[10][11]', 'In Saudi Arabia, Abu Nidal helped found a small group of young Palestinians who called themselves the Palestine Secret Organization. The activism cost him his job and home: Aramco fired him, and the Saudi government imprisoned then expelled him.[26] He returned to Nablus with his wife and family, and joined Yasser Arafat\'s Fatah faction of the PLO. Working as an odd-job man, he was committed to Palestinian politics but was not particularly active, until Israel won the 1967 Six-Day War, capturing the Golan Heights, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Melman writes that ""the entrance of the Israel Defense Forces tanks into Nablus was a traumatic experience for him. The conquest aroused him to action.""[35]', ""Shortly after Black September, Abu Nidal began accusing the PLO, over his Voice of Palestine radio station in Iraq, of cowardice for having agreed to a ceasefire with Hussein.[37] During Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, he joined Palestinian activist and writer Naji Allush and Abu Daoud (leader of the Black September Organization responsible for the 1972 Munich Massacre) in calling for greater democracy within Fatah and revenge against King Hussein.[38]"", ""On the day of the attack, 56 heads of state were meeting in Algiers for the 4th conference of the Non-Aligned Movement. According to Seale, the Saudi Embassy operation had been commissioned by Iraq's president, Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr, as a distraction because he was jealous that Algeria was hosting the conference. Seale writes one of the hostage-takers admitted that he had been told to fly the hostages around until the conference was over.[43]"", 'Two months later, in November 1973 (just after the Yom Kippur War in October), the ANO hijacked KLM Flight 861, this time using the name Arab Nationalist Youth Organization.

In response, in March or July 1974, Arafat expelled Abu Nidal from Fatah.[45]', 'In addition to Fatah: The Revolutionary Council, the ANO called itself the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, Black June (for actions against Syria), Black September (for actions against Jordan), the Revolutionary Arab Brigades, the Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims, the Egyptian Revolution, Revolutionary Egypt, Al-Asifa (""the Storm,"" a name also used by Fatah), Al-Iqab (""the Punishment""), and the Arab Nationalist Youth Organization.[1]', 'In addition to Fatah: The Revolutionary Council, the ANO called itself the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, Black June (for actions against Syria), Black September (for actions against Jordan), the Revolutionary Arab Brigades, the Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims, the Egyptian Revolution, Revolutionary Egypt, Al-Asifa (""the Storm,"" a name also used by Fatah), Al-Iqab (""the Punishment""), and the Arab Nationalist Youth Organization.[1]']"

He was the only president elected under the banner of the Federalist Party. Adams's term was dominated by the issue of the French Revolutionary Wars, and his insistence on American neutrality led to fierce criticism from both the Jeffersonian Republicans and from some in his own party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts, and built up the Army and Navy in the undeclared naval war with France. He was the first president to reside in the White House."", 'The sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility of the vice president is to preside over the U.S. Senate, where they were empowered to cast a tie-breaking vote.[144] Early in his term, Adams became deeply involved in a lengthy Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government. Although the House agreed that the president should be addressed simply as ""George Washington, President of the United States"", the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [the United States\'] Liberties) for the president.[145] Some senators favored a variant of Highness or the lesser Excellency.[146] Anti-federalists in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all; Jefferson described them as ""superlatively ridiculous.""[147] They argued that these ""distinctions,"" as Adams called them, violated the Constitution\'s prohibition on titles of nobility. Adams said that the distinctions were necessary because the highest office of the United States must be marked with ""dignity and splendor"". He was widely derided for his combative nature and stubbornness, especially as he actively debated and lectured the senators. ""For forty minutes he harangued us from the chair,"" wrote Senator William Maclay of Pennsylvania. Maclay became Adams\'s fiercest opponent and repeatedly expressed personal contempt for him in public and private. He likened Adams to ""a monkey just put into breeches.""[148] Ralph Izard suggested that Adams be referred to as ""His Rotundity,"" a joke which soon became popular.[149] On May 14, 1789, the Senate decided that the title of ""Mr. President"" would be used.[150] Privately, Adams conceded that his vice presidency had begun poorly and that perhaps he had been out of the country too long to know the sentiment of the people. Washington quietly expressed his displeasure with the fuss.[151]', 'Adams played a minor role in politics as vice president. He attended few cabinet meetings, and the President sought his counsel infrequently.[144] While Adams brought energy and dedication to the office,[156] by mid-1789 he had already found it ""not quite adapted to my character ... too inactive, and mechanical.""[157] He wrote, ""My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.""[158] Adams\'s initial behavior in the Senate made him a target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, he grew accustomed to a marginal role, and rarely intervened in debate.[159] Adams never questioned Washington\'s courage or patriotism, but Washington did join Franklin and others as the object of Adams\'s ire or envy. ""The History of our Revolution will be one continued lie,"" Adams declared. ""The essence of the whole will be that Dr. Franklin\'s electrical Rod smote the Earth and out sprung General Washington. That Franklin electrified him with his Rod – and henceforth these two conducted all the Policy, Negotiations, Legislatures and War.""[160] Adams won reelection with little difficulty in 1792 with 77 votes. His strongest challenger, George Clinton, had 50.[161]', 'News of the disastrous peace mission arrived in a memorandum from Marshall on March 4, 1798. Adams, not wanting to incite violent impulses among the populace, announced that the mission had failed without providing details.[200] He also sent a message to Congress asking for a renewal of the nation\'s defenses. The Republicans frustrated the President\'s defense measures. Suspecting that he might be hiding material favorable to France, Republicans in the House, with the support of Federalists who had heard rumors of what was contained in the messages, voted overwhelmingly to demand that Adams release the papers. Once they were released, the Republicans, according to Abigail, were ""struck dumb.""[201] Benjamin Franklin Bache, editor of the Philadelphia Aurora, blamed Adams\'s aggression for the disaster. Among the general public, the affair substantially weakened popular American support of France. Adams reached the height of his popularity as many in the country called for full-scale war against the French.[202]', 'The administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial on the eve of the 1800 presidential election.[206] Vocal opponents of the Federalists were imprisoned or fined under the Sedition Act for criticizing the government.[207] Among them was Congressman Matthew Lyon of Vermont, who was sentenced to four months in jail for criticizing the President.[208] The alien acts were not stringently enforced because Adams resisted Secretary of State Timothy Pickering\'s attempts to deport aliens, although many left on their own, largely in response to the hostile environment.[206] Republicans were outraged. Jefferson, disgusted by the acts, wrote nothing publicly but partnered with Madison to secretly draft the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. Jefferson wrote for Kentucky that states had the ""natural right"" to nullify any acts they deemed unconstitutional. Writing to Madison, he speculated that as a last resort the states might have to ""sever ourselves from the union we so much value.""[209] Federalists reacted bitterly to the resolutions, which were to have far more lasting implications for the country than the Alien and Sedition Acts. Still, the acts energized and unified the Republican Party while doing little to unite the Federalists.[210]', 'On February 18, 1799, Adams nominated diplomat William Vans Murray for a peace mission to France without consulting either his cabinet or Abigail, who nonetheless upon hearing of it described it as a ""master stroke."" To placate Republicans, he nominated Patrick Henry and Ellsworth to accompany Murray, and the Senate immediately approved them on March 3. Henry declined the nomination and Adams chose William Richardson Davie to replace him.[226] Hamilton strongly criticized the decision, as did Adams\'s cabinet members, who maintained frequent communication with him. Adams again questioned their loyalty but did not remove them.[187] To the annoyance of many, Adams spent March to September 1799 in Peacefield. He returned to Trenton, where the government had set up temporary quarters due to the yellow fever epidemic, after a letter arrived from Talleyrand confirming that American ministers would be received. Adams then decided to send the commissioners to France.[227] Adams arrived in Trenton on October 10.[228] Shortly after, Hamilton, in a breach of military protocol, arrived uninvited at the city to speak with the President, urging him not to send the peace commissioners but instead to ally with Britain to restore the Bourbons. ""I heard him with perfect good humor, though never in my life did I hear a man talk more like a fool,"" Adams said. On November 15, the commissioners set sail for Paris.[229]', 'Adams made his first official visit to the nation\'s new seat of government in early June 1800. Amid the ""raw and unfinished"" cityscape, the President found the public buildings ""in a much greater forwardness of completion than expected.""[247] He moved into the nearly completed President\'s Mansion (later known as the White House) on November 1. Abigail arrived a few weeks later. On arrival, Adams wrote to her, ""Before I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.""[248] The Senate of the 7th Congress met for the first time in the new Congress House (later known as the Capitol building) on November 17, 1800. On November 22, Adams delivered his fourth State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress.[249] This would be the last annual message any president would personally deliver to Congress for the next 113 years.[250]', 'Opposition from the Federalist Party was at times equally intense. Some, including Pickering, accused Adams of colluding with Jefferson so that he would end up either president or vice president.[254] Hamilton was hard at work, attempting to sabotage the President\'s reelection. Planning an indictment of Adams\'s character, he requested and received private documents from both the ousted cabinet secretaries and Wolcott.[255] The letter was intended for only a few Federalist electors. Upon seeing a draft, several Federalists urged Hamilton not to send it. Wolcott wrote that ""the poor old man"" could do himself in without Hamilton\'s assistance. Hamilton did not heed their advice.[256] On October 24, he sent a pamphlet strongly attacking Adams\'s policies and character. Hamilton denounced the ""precipitate nomination"" of Murray, the pardoning of Fries, and the firing of Pickering. He vilified the President\'s ""disgusting egotism"" and ""ungovernable temper."" Adams, he concluded, was ""emotionally unstable, given to impulsive and irrational decisions, unable to coexist with his closest advisers, and generally unfit to be president.""[233] Strangely, it ended by saying that the electors should support Adams and Pinckney equally.[257] Thanks to Burr, who had covertly obtained a copy, the pamphlet became public knowledge and was distributed throughout the country by Republicans.[258] The pamphlet ended Hamilton\'s political career and helped ensure Adams\'s already-likely defeat.[257]', 'Adams generally stayed quiet on public matters. He did not publicly denounce Jefferson\'s actions as president, believing that ""instead of opposing Systematically any Administration, running down their Characters and opposing all their Measures right or wrong, We ought to Support every Administration as far as We can in Justice.""[276][277] When a disgruntled James Callender, angry at not being appointed to an office, turned on the President by revealing the Sally Hemings affair, Adams said nothing.[278] John Quincy was elected to the Senate in 1803. Shortly thereafter, both he and his father crossed party lines to support Jefferson\'s Louisiana Purchase.[279] The only major political incident involving the elder Adams during the Jefferson years was a dispute with Mercy Otis Warren in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had written a history of the American Revolution attacking Adams for his ""partiality for monarchy"" and ""pride of talents and much ambition."" A tempestuous correspondence ensued between her and Adams. In time, their friendship healed.[280] Adams did privately criticize the President over his Embargo Act,[277] although John Quincy voted for it.[281] John Quincy resigned from the Senate in 1808 after the Federalist-controlled Massachusetts Senate refused to nominate him for a second term. After the Federalists denounced John Quincy as no longer being of their party, Adams wrote to him that he himself had long since ""abdicated and disclaimed the name and character and attributes of that sect.""[4]', 'Abigail died of typhoid on October 28, 1818, at Peacefield.[295] 1824 was filled with excitement in America, featuring a four-way presidential contest that included John Quincy. The Marquis de Lafayette toured the country and met with Adams, who greatly enjoyed Lafayette\'s visit to Peacefield.[296] Adams was delighted by the election of John Quincy to the presidency. The results became official in February 1825 after a deadlock was decided in the House of Representatives. He remarked, ""No man who ever held the office of President would congratulate a friend on obtaining it.""[297]', 'Historian George C. Herring argued that Adams was the most independent minded of the Founders.[347] Though he formally aligned with the Federalists, he was somewhat a party unto himself, at times disagreeing with the Federalists as much as he did the Republicans.[348] He was often described as prickly, but his tenacity was fed by decisions made in the face of universal opposition.[347] Adams was often combative, as he admitted: ""[As President] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore.""[349] Stubbornness was seen as one of his defining traits, a fact for which Adams made no apology. ""Thanks to God that he gave me stubbornness when I know I am right,"" he wrote.[350] His resolve to advance peace with France while maintaining a posture of defense reduced his popularity and contributed to his defeat for reelection.[351] Most historians applaud him for avoiding an all-out war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts is almost always condemned.[352]', 'The first President from the North, John Adams, asserted and essayed to put into practice the supremacy of the ""National"" power over the states and the citizens thereof. He was sustained in his attempted usurpations by all the New England states and by a powerful public sentiment in each of the Middle States. The ""strict constructionists"" of the Constitution were not slow in raising the standard of opposition against a pernicious error.[355]']"

In 1739, Massachusetts was facing a serious currency shortage, and Deacon Adams and the Boston Caucus created a ""land bank"" which issued paper money to borrowers who mortgaged their land as security.[29][30] The land bank was generally supported by the citizenry and the popular party, which dominated the House of Representatives, the lower branch of the General Court. Opposition to the land bank came from the more aristocratic ""court party"", who were supporters of the royal governor Jonathan Belcher and controlled the Governor\'s Council, the upper chamber of the General Court. The court party used its influence to have the British Parliament dissolve the land bank in 1741.[31][32] Directors of the land bank, including Deacon Adams, became personally liable for the currency still in circulation, payable in silver and gold. Lawsuits over the bank persisted for years, even after Deacon Adams\'s death, and the younger Samuel Adams often had to defend the family estate from seizure by the government. For Adams, these lawsuits ""served as a constant personal reminder that Britain\'s power over the colonies could be exercised in arbitrary and destructive ways.""[33]', ""Adams earnestly endeavored to awaken his fellow citizens over the perceived attacks on their Constitutional rights, with emphasis aimed at Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson. Hutchinson stressed that no one matched Adams' efforts in promoting the radical Whig position and the revolutionary cause, which Adams accordingly demonstrated with his numerous published and pointedly written essays and letters. In each of its issues from early September through mid-October of 1771, the Gazette published Adams' inciteful essays, one of which criticized the Parliament for using colonial taxes to pay Hutchinson's annual salary of £2,000.[75] In a letter of February 1770, published by the New York Journal[d] Adams maintained that it became increasingly difficult to view King George III as one who was not passively involved in Parliamentary decisions. In it he asked if anyone of common sense could deny that the King had assumed a “personal and decisive” role against the Americans.[76]"", 'Officials such as Governor Francis Bernard believed that common people acted only under the direction of agitators and blamed the violence on Adams.[91] This interpretation was revived by scholars in the early 20th century, who viewed Adams as a master of propaganda who manipulated mobs into doing his bidding.[92][55] For example, historian John C. Miller wrote in 1936 in what became the standard biography of Adams[93] that Adams ""controlled"" Boston with his ""trained mob"".[89] Some modern scholars have argued that this interpretation is a myth, and that there is no evidence that Adams had anything to do with the Stamp Act riots.[94][95][96][e] After the fact, Adams did approve of the August 14 action because he saw no other legal options to resist what he viewed as an unconstitutional act by Parliament, but he condemned attacks on officials\' homes as ""mobbish"".[97][98][99] According to the modern scholarly interpretation of Adams, he supported legal methods of resisting parliamentary taxation, such as petitions, boycotts, and nonviolent demonstrations, but he opposed mob violence which he saw as illegal, dangerous, and counter-productive.[99][100]', ""British colonial secretary Lord Hillsborough, hoping to prevent a repeat of the Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter.[119][120] On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification.[121][120] Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.[121]"", 'Governor Bernard wrote to London in response to the Liberty incident and the struggle over the Circular Letter, informing his superiors that troops were needed in Boston to restore order.[125] Lord Hillsborough ordered four regiments of the British Army to Boston.', ""Learning that British troops were on the way, the Boston Town Meeting met on September 12, 1768, and requested that Governor Bernard convene the General Court.[126] Bernard refused, so the town meeting called on the other Massachusetts towns to send representatives to meet at Faneuil Hall beginning on September 22.[127] About 100 towns sent delegates to the convention, which was effectively an unofficial session of the Massachusetts House. The convention issued a letter which insisted that Boston was not a lawless town, using language more moderate than what Adams desired, and that the impending military occupation violated Bostonians' natural, constitutional, and charter rights.[128][129] By the time that the convention adjourned, British troop transports had arrived in Boston Harbor.[129] Two regiments disembarked in October 1768, followed by two more in November.[130]"", ""After the Boston Massacre, Adams and other town leaders met with Bernard's successor Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, to demand the withdrawal of all occupational troops from Boston.[145][146] The situation remained explosive, so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William.[147] Adams wanted the soldiers involved in the massacre to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation.[148] He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that they would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal.[149][150] However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; he thought that the soldiers should have been convicted of murder.[151]"", 'Governor Hutchinson became concerned that the committees of correspondence were growing into an independence movement, so he convened the General Court in January 1773.[165] Addressing the legislature, Hutchinson argued that denying the supremacy of Parliament, as some committees had done, came dangerously close to rebellion. ""I know of no line that can be drawn"", he said, ""between the supreme authority of Parliament and the total independence of the colonies.""[166][167] Adams and the House responded that the Massachusetts Charter did not establish Parliament\'s supremacy over the province, and so Parliament could not claim that authority now.[168] Hutchinson soon realized that he had made a major blunder by initiating a public debate about independence and the extent of Parliament\'s authority in the colonies.[169] The Boston Committee of Correspondence published its statement of colonial rights, along with Hutchinson\'s exchange with the Massachusetts House, in the widely distributed ""Boston Pamphlet"".[166]', 'Adams and the correspondence committees promoted opposition to the Tea Act.[186] In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England.[187] In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down.[188] The Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused.[189][190] With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support.[191]', 'Governor Hutchinson refused to grant permission for the Dartmouth to leave without paying the duty. Two more tea ships arrived in Boston Harbor, the Eleanor and the Beaver. The fourth ship, the William, was stranded near Cape Cod and never arrived in Boston. December 16 was the last day of the Dartmouth\'s deadline, and about 7,000 people gathered around the Old South Meeting House.[196] Adams received a report that Governor Hutchinson had again refused to let the ships leave, and he announced, ""This meeting can do nothing further to save the country.""[197][198] According to a popular story, Adams\'s statement was a prearranged signal for the ""tea party"" to begin. However, this claim did not appear in print until nearly a century after the event, in a biography of Adams written by his great-grandson, who apparently misinterpreted the evidence.[199] According to eyewitness accounts, people did not leave the meeting until ten or fifteen minutes after Adams\'s alleged ""signal"", and Adams in fact tried to stop people from leaving because the meeting was not yet over.[200][199][j]', 'Postwar economic troubles in western Massachusetts led to an uprising known as Shays\' Rebellion, which began in 1786. Small farmers, angered by high taxes and debts, armed themselves and shut down debtor courts in Worcester and Hampshire Counties, prompting Governor James Bowdoin to consult Adams first. Adams at a Boston town meeting oversaw the drafting of a circular letter which denounced these actions as unconstitutional and as acts treason. [266][267] As Massachusetts\' senator representing Boston, Adams played an important role in forming Governor Bowdoin\'s hard-line policy to suppress the rebellion.[267] His old political ally James Warren thought that Adams had forsaken his principles, but Adams saw no contradiction. He approved of rebellion against an unrepresentative government, as had happened during the American Revolution, but he opposed taking up arms against a republican government, composed of fellow American citizens, where problems should be remedied through elections. He thought that the leaders of Shays\'s Rebellion should be hanged, reportedly saying that ""the man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death"", and urged Governor Bowdoin to use military force, who obliged and sent four thousand militiamen to put down the uprising.[268][269][267]', ""In 1789, Adams was elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts and served in that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting governor. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, the first of four annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's Jeffersonian Republicans, who were opposed to the Federalist Party. Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion.[282] Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the Jay Treaty in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist.[283][284] In that year's U. S. presidential election, Republicans in Virginia cast 15 electoral votes for Adams in an effort to make him Jefferson's vice-president,[285] but Federalist John Adams won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice-president.

Affleck then appeared as a small-town sheriff in the supernatural horror film Phantoms.[41] Stephen Holden of The New York Times wondered why actors like Affleck and Peter O\'Toole had agreed to appear in the ""junky"" film: ""Affleck\'s thudding performance suggests he is reading his dialogue for the first time, directly from cue cards.""[67]', 'Affleck\'s starring role as a recovering alcoholic in the sports drama The Way Back (2020) was widely praised.[189] The themes of the movie were ""close to home"" for Affleck.[190] He relapsed during pre-production in 2018[190] and the movie was shot in the days after he left rehab; Affleck agreed to put his salary in escrow and was accompanied to set by a sober coach.[191] Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair said it was hard to avoid the movie\'s ""meta angle"": ""Affleck handles his self-conscious task with a generous humility—giving a performance built not out of histrionics or big actor moments, but instead from the messy details of a man in a plateaued distress"".[192] David Sims of The Atlantic praised the ""subtlety"", ""vulnerability"" and ""lumbering physicality"" of his performance, describing it as ""the rawest and most natural"" work of his career.[193] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cinemas closed in the second week of the movie\'s release and Warner Bros. made it available to view-on-demand earlier than scheduled.[194] He received a Best Actor nomination at the 2021 Critics\' Choice Awards.[195] Also in 2021, Snyder\'s director\'s cut of Justice League featured a newly filmed scene with Affleck.[196]', 'Affleck is a supporter of the A-T Children\'s Project.

Rap Brown.[58] Agnew\'s principal concern was to maintain law and order,[59] and he denounced Brown as a professional agitator, saying, ""I hope they put him away and throw away the key.""[60] When the Kerner Commission, appointed by President Johnson to investigate the causes of the unrest, reported that the principal factor was institutional white racism,[61] Agnew dismissed these findings, blaming the ""permissive climate and misguided compassion"" and adding: ""It is not the centuries of racism and deprivation that have built to an explosive crescendo, but\xa0... that lawbreaking has become a socially acceptable and occasionally stylish form of dissent"".[62] In March 1968, when faced with a student boycott at Bowie State College, a historically black institution, Agnew again blamed outside agitators and refused to negotiate with the students. When a student committee came to Annapolis and demanded a meeting, Agnew closed the college and ordered more than 200 arrests.[63]', 'At least until the April 1968 disturbances, Agnew\'s image was that of a liberal Republican. Since 1964 he had supported the presidential ambitions of Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, and early in 1968, with that year\'s elections looming, he became chairman of the ""Rockefeller for President"" citizens\' committee.[70] When in a televised speech on March 21, 1968, Rockefeller shocked his supporters with an apparently unequivocal withdrawal from the race, Agnew was dismayed and humiliated; despite his very public role in the Rockefeller campaign, he had received no advance warning of the decision. He took this as a personal insult and as a blow to his credibility.[71][72]', 'In 1968, the Nixon–Agnew ticket faced two principal opponents. The Democrats, at a convention marred by violent demonstrations, had nominated Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Maine Senator Edmund Muskie as their standard-bearers.[94] The segregationist former Governor of Alabama, George Wallace, ran as a third-party candidate and was expected to do well in the Deep South.[95] Nixon, mindful of the restrictions he had labored under as Dwight Eisenhower\'s running mate in 1952 and 1956, was determined to give Agnew a much freer rein and to make it clear his running mate had his support.[96] Agnew could also usefully play an ""attack dog"" role, as Nixon had in 1952.[87]', 'Throughout September, Agnew was in the news, generally as a result of what one reporter called his ""offensive and sometimes dangerous banality"".[99] He used the derogatory term ""Polack"" to describe Polish-Americans, referred to a Japanese-American reporter as ""the fat Jap"",[100] and appeared to dismiss poor socio-economic conditions by stating that ""if you\'ve seen one slum you\'ve seen them all.""[95] He attacked Humphrey as soft on communism, an appeaser like Britain\'s prewar prime minister Neville Chamberlain.[101] Agnew was mocked by his Democratic opponents; a Humphrey commercial displayed the message ""Agnew for Vice President?"" against a soundtrack of prolonged hysterical laughter that degenerated into a painful cough, before a final message: ""This would be funny if it weren\'t so serious...""[102] Agnew\'s comments outraged many, but Nixon did not rein him in; such right-wing populism had a strong appeal in the Southern states and was an effective counter to Wallace. Agnew\'s rhetoric was also popular in some Northern areas,[103] and helped to galvanize ""white backlash"" into something less racially defined, more attuned to the suburban ethic defined by historian Peter B. Levy as ""orderliness, personal responsibility, the sanctity of hard work, the nuclear family, and law and order"".[104]', 'Agnew thus put into words feelings that many Republicans and conservatives had long felt about the news media.[133] Television network executives and commentators responded with outrage. Julian Goodman, president of NBC, stated that Agnew had made an ""appeal to prejudice\xa0... it is regrettable that the Vice President of the United States should deny to TV freedom of the press"".[135] Frank Stanton, head of CBS, accused Agnew of trying to intimidate the news media, and his news anchor, Walter Cronkite, agreed.[136] The speech was praised by conservatives from both parties, and gave Agnew a following among the right.[137] Agnew deemed the Des Moines speech one of his finest moments[138]', ""Through 1971, it was uncertain if Agnew would be retained on the ticket as Nixon sought a second term in 1972. Neither Nixon nor his aides were enamored of Agnew's independence and outspokenness, and were less than happy at Agnew's popularity among conservatives suspicious of Nixon. The President considered replacing him with Treasury Secretary John Connally, a Democrat and former Governor of Texas. For his part, Agnew was unhappy with many of Nixon's stances, especially in foreign policy, disliking Nixon's rapprochement with China (on which Agnew was not consulted) and believing that the Vietnam War could be won with sufficient force. Even after Nixon announced his re-election bid at the start of 1972, it was unclear if Agnew would be his running mate, and it was not until July 21 that Nixon asked Agnew and the vice president accepted. A public announcement was made the following day.[161]"", 'Under increasing pressure to resign, Agnew took the position that a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded that it would be improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts.[177] Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution.[178] Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain on the condition that he would not serve jail time.[179] He wrote in his memoirs that he entered the plea bargain because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not get a fair trial.[180] He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.[181]', 'Agnew pursued other business interests: an unsuccessful land deal in Kentucky, and an equally fruitless partnership with golfer Doug Sanders over a beer distributionship in Texas.[187] In 1976 he published a novel, The Canfield Decision, about an American vice president\'s troubled relationship with his president. The book received mixed reviews, but was commercially successful, with Agnew receiving $100,000 for serialization rights alone.[188] The book landed Agnew in controversy; his fictional counterpart, George Canfield, refers to ""Jewish cabals and Zionist lobbies"" and their hold over the American media, a charge which Agnew, while on a book tour, asserted was true in real life.[189] This brought complaints from Seymour Graubard, of the Anti-Defamation League of B\'nai B\'rith, and a rebuke from President Ford, then campaigning for re-election.[190] Agnew denied any antisemitism or bigotry: ""My contention is that routinely the American news media ... favors the Israeli position and does not in a balanced way present the other equities"".[191] Also in 1976, Agnew announced that he was establishing a charitable foundation ""Education for Democracy"", but nothing more was heard of this after B\'nai B\'rith accused it of being a front for Agnew\'s anti-Israeli views.[187]', 'Agnew pursued other business interests: an unsuccessful land deal in Kentucky, and an equally fruitless partnership with golfer Doug Sanders over a beer distributionship in Texas.[187] In 1976 he published a novel, The Canfield Decision, about an American vice president\'s troubled relationship with his president.

Stating he felt ""totally abandoned"", Agnew declined to take any and all phone calls from President Nixon.[200] When Nixon died in 1994, his daughters invited Agnew to attend the funeral at Yorba Linda, California. At first he refused, still bitter over how he had been treated by the White House in his final days as vice president; over the years he had rejected various overtures from the Nixon camp to mend fences. He was persuaded to accept the invitation, and received a warm welcome there from his former colleagues.[201] ""I decided after twenty years of resentment to put it aside"", he said.[202] A year later, Agnew appeared at the Capitol in Washington for the dedication of a bust of him, to be placed with those of other vice presidents. Agnew commented: ""I am not blind or deaf to the fact that some people feel that ... the Senate by commissioning this bust is giving me an honor I don\'t deserve. I would remind these people that ... this ceremony has less to do with Spiro Agnew than with the office I held"".[203]', 'For Agnew himself, despite his rise from his origins in Baltimore to next in line to the presidency, ""there could be little doubt that history\'s judgment was already upon him, the first Vice President of the United States to have resigned in disgrace. All that he achieved or sought to achieve in his public life\xa0... had been buried in that tragic and irrefutable act"".[209]']"

He was a member of the Theban royal house, the son of pharaoh Seqenenre Tao and brother of the last pharaoh of the Seventeenth Dynasty, Kamose. During the reign of his father or grandfather, Thebes rebelled against the Hyksos, the rulers of Lower Egypt. When he was seven years old, his father was killed,[25] and he was about ten when his brother died of unknown causes after reigning only three years. Ahmose I assumed the throne after the death of his brother,[26] and upon coronation became known as Nebpehtyre, nb-pḥtj-rꜥ ""The Lord of Strength is Ra"".', 'Ahmose descended from the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty. His grandfather and grandmother, Senakhtenre Ahmose and Tetisheri, had at least twelve children, including Seqenenre Tao and Ahhotep I. The brother and sister, according to the tradition of Egyptian queens, married, and had sons Kamose and Ahmose I, as well as several daughters.[27] Ahmose I followed in the tradition of his father and married several of his sisters, making Ahmose-Nefertari his chief wife.[28] They had several children including daughters Meritamun B, Sitamun A and sons Siamun A, Ahmose-ankh,[29] Amenhotep I and Ramose A[30] (the ""A"" and ""B"" designations after the names are a convention used by Egyptologists to distinguish between royal children and wives that otherwise have the same name). They may also have been the parents of Mutnofret, who would become the wife of later successor Thutmose I. Ahmose-ankh was Ahmose\'s heir apparent, but he preceded his father in death sometime between Ahmose\'s 17th and 22nd regnal year.[31] Ahmose was succeeded instead by his eldest surviving son, Amenhotep I, with whom he might have shared a short coregency.[32]', ""The art of glass making is thought to have developed during Ahmose's reign. The oldest samples of glass appear to have been defective pieces of faience, but intentional crafting of glass did not occur until the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty.[66] One of the earliest glass beads found contains the names of both Ahmose and Amenhotep I, written in a style dated to about the time of their reigns.[67] If glassmaking was developed no earlier than Ahmose's reign and the first objects are dated to no later than his successor's reign, it is quite likely that it was one of his subjects who developed the craft.[67]"", ""Under Ahmose's reign, the city of Thebes became the capital for the whole of Egypt, as it had been under the 11th Dynasty in the early Middle Kingdom. It also became the center for a newly established professional civil service, where there was a greater demand for scribes and the literate as the royal archives began to fill with accounts and reports.[69] Having Thebes as the capital was probably a strategic choice as it was located at the center of the country, the logical conclusion from having had to fight the Hyksos in the north as well as the Nubians to the south. Any future opposition at either border could be met easily.[70]"", ""Ahmose I's mummy was discovered in 1881 within the Deir el-Bahri Cache, located in the hills directly above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. He was interred along with the mummies of other Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasty leaders Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II and Ramesses IX, as well as the Twenty-first Dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II and Siamun.[79]"", ""Ahmose I's mummy was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero on June 9, 1886. It was found within a coffin that bore his name in hieroglyphs, and on his bandages his name was again written in hieratic script. While the cedarwood coffin's style dates it squarely to the time of the Eighteenth Dynasty, it was neither of royal style nor craftsmanship, and any gilding or inlays may have been stripped in antiquity.[80] He had evidently been moved from his original burial place, re-wrapped and placed within the cache at Deir el-Bahri during the reign of  the Twenty-first Dynasty priest-king Pinedjem II, whose name also appeared on the mummy's wrappings. Around his neck a garland of Delphinium flowers had been placed. The body bore signs of having been plundered by ancient grave-robbers, his head having been broken off from his body and his nose smashed.[81]"", 'The first piece of evidence consists of three small objects which contain both of their praenomen next to one another: the aforementioned small glass bead, a small feldspar amulet and a broken stele, all of which are written in the proper style for the early Eighteenth Dynasty.[67] The last stele said that Amenhotep was ""given life eternally"", which is an Egyptian idiom meaning that a king is alive, but the name of Ahmose does not have the usual epithet ""true of voice"" which is given to dead kings. Since praenomen are only assumed upon taking the throne, and assuming that both were in fact alive at the same time, it is indicated that both were reigning at the same time. There is, however, the possibility that Amenhotep I merely wished to associate himself with his beloved father, who reunited Egypt.[67]', 'Third, Ahmose\'s wife, Ahmose Nefertari, was called both ""King\'s Great Wife"" and ""King\'s Mother"" in two stelae which were set up at the limestone quarries of Ma\'sara in Ahmose\'s 22nd year.   For her to literally be a ""King\'s Mother,"" Amenhotep would already have to be a king. It is possible that the title was only honorific, as Ahhotep II assumed the title without being the mother of any known king;[85] though there is a possibility that her son Amenemhat was made Amenhotep I\'s co-regent, but preceded him in death.[31]', 'Second Intermediate PeriodSixteenthDynasty\nAbydosDynasty\nSeventeenthDynasty', 'Twenty-first Dynasty of EgyptSmendes Amenemnisu Psusennes I Amenemope Osorkon the Elder Siamun Psusennes II', 'Twenty-third Dynasty of EgyptHarsiese A Takelot II Pedubast I Shoshenq VI Osorkon III Takelot III Rudamun Menkheperre Ini\nTwenty-fourth Dynasty of EgyptTefnakht Bakenranef']"

Albert referred to her as the ""House Dragon"", and manoeuvred to dislodge the Baroness from her position.[37]', 'By 1844, Albert had managed to modernise the royal finances and, through various economies, had sufficient capital to purchase Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as a private residence for their growing family.[50] Over the next few years a house modelled in the style of an Italianate villa was built to the designs of Albert and Thomas Cubitt.[51] Albert laid out the grounds, and improved the estate and farm.[52] Albert managed and improved the other royal estates; his model farm at Windsor (Shaw Farm) was admired by his biographers,[53] and under his stewardship the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall—the hereditary property of the Prince of Wales—steadily increased.[54]', 'Unlike many landowners who approved of child labour and opposed Peel\'s repeal of the Corn Laws, Albert supported moves to raise working ages and free up trade.[55] In 1846, Albert was rebuked by Lord George Bentinck when he attended the debate on the Corn Laws in the House of Commons to give tacit support to Peel.[56] During Peel\'s premiership, Albert\'s authority behind, or beside, the throne became more apparent. He had access to all the Queen\'s papers, was drafting her correspondence[57] and was present when she met her ministers; he would even see them alone in her absence.[58] The clerk of the Privy Council, Charles Greville, wrote of him: ""He is King to all intents and purposes.""[59]', 'The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was president from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it.[54][70] Albert served as president of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project.[71] In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park.[72] Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith.[73] Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.[54]', ""In 1852, John Camden Neild, an eccentric miser, left Victoria an unexpected legacy, which Albert used to obtain the freehold of Balmoral. As usual, he embarked on an extensive programme of improvements.[77] The same year, he was appointed to several of the offices left vacant by the death of the Duke of Wellington, including the mastership of Trinity House and the colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards.[78] With Wellington's death, Albert was able to propose and campaign for modernisation of the army, which was long overdue.[79] Thinking that the military was unready for war and that Christian rule was preferable to Islamic rule, Albert counselled a diplomatic solution to conflict between the Russian and Ottoman empires. Palmerston was more bellicose, and favoured a policy that would prevent further Russian expansion.[80] Palmerston was manoeuvred out of the cabinet in December 1853, but at about the same time a Russian fleet attacked the Ottoman fleet at anchor at Sinop. The London press depicted the attack as a criminal massacre, and Palmerston's popularity surged as Albert's fell.[81] Within two weeks, Palmerston was re-appointed a minister.

He gained prominence as a black lawyer willing to fight for equal rights in the Berwyn desegregation case and represented black defendants in other high-profile cases, including the Trenton Six, a group of black men arrested for murder in Trenton, New Jersey.', 'In 1948, Alexander became involved with the case of the Trenton Six, a group of black men arrested in Trenton, New Jersey, accused of robbery and murder.[40] Trenton police induced confessions from five of the six, and all were convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death.[40] The Civil Rights Congress (CRC), the legal arm of the Communist Party USA, represented three of the men during their appeal; the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, at the request of their chief counsel, Thurgood Marshall, hired Alexander to represent two of the others.[41] In 1949, the Supreme Court of New Jersey granted the men a new trial but prohibited the CRC from representing any of the defendants because they found that the group had unfairly influenced jury pools through the news media.[42]']"

His father was the eldest son of King George I of Greece by his wife, Olga Constantinovna of Russia; his mother was the daughter of Frederick III, German Emperor, and Victoria, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom.[1] His parents' cousins included King George V of the United Kingdom and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Wilhelm II, German Emperor, was his maternal uncle.[2]"", 'The ruling dynasty of Greece (the House of Glücksburg) was of German-Danish origin, and Constantine and Sophia were seen as far too German by the Venizelists, but even though the marriage of the king to a Greek presented an opportunity to Hellenize the royal family, and counter criticisms that it was a foreign institution, both Venizelists and Constantinists opposed the match. The Venizelists feared it would give Alexander a means to communicate with his exiled family through Colonel Manos and both sides of the political divide were unhappy at the king marrying a commoner.[35] Although Venizelos was a friend of Petros Manos,[9] the prime minister warned the king that marrying her would be unpopular in the eyes of the people.[34][c]', ""When Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, visited Athens in March 1918, to confer the Order of the Bath upon the king, Alexander feared that a marriage between him and Princess Mary of the United Kingdom would be discussed as part of an attempt to consolidate the relationship between Greece and Britain. To Alexander's relief, Arthur asked to meet Aspasia, and declared that, if he were younger, he would have sought to marry her himself.[34] For the foreign powers, and particularly the British ambassador, the marriage was seen as positive.[11] The British authorities feared that Alexander would abdicate in order to marry Aspasia if the wedding was blocked, and they wanted to avoid Greece becoming a republic in case it led to instability or an increase in French influence at their expense.[35]"", ""Two days later, Alexander's body was conveyed to Athens Cathedral, where it lay in state until his funeral on 29 October. Once again, the royal family were refused permission to return to Greece, and Queen Olga was the only member who attended.[52] Foreign powers were represented by the Prince Regent of Serbia with his sister Princess Helen wife of John Constantinovich of Russia, the Crown Prince of Sweden with his uncle Prince Eugene, Duke of Nericia, and Rear-Admirals Sir George Hope of the United Kingdom and Dumesnil of France, as well as members of the Athens diplomatic corps.[53]""]"

Although they were of royal blood,[a] the family lived a comparatively modest life. They did not possess great wealth; her father's income from an army commission was about £800 per year, and their house was a rent-free grace and favour property.[3] Occasionally, Hans Christian Andersen was invited to call and tell the children stories before bedtime.[4]"", ""Thomas Longley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, married the couple on 10 March 1863 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The choice of venue was criticised widely. As the ceremony took place outside London, the press complained that large public crowds would not be able to view the spectacle. Prospective guests thought it awkward to get to and, as the venue was small, some people who had expected invitations were disappointed. The Danes were dismayed because only Alexandra's closest relations were invited. The British court was still in mourning for Prince Albert, so ladies were restricted to wearing grey, lilac, or mauve.[15] As the couple left Windsor for their honeymoon at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, they were cheered by the schoolboys of neighbouring Eton College, including Lord Randolph Churchill.[16]"", ""The Waleses made Sandringham House their preferred residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage was in many ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation.[26][27] This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift.[28] Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever.[29] Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry, Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, humanitarian Agnes Keyser, and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit her husband as he lay dying.[30] Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.[31]"", 'In 1910, Alexandra became the first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. In a remarkable departure from precedent, for two hours she sat in the Ladies\' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill, to remove the right of the House of Lords to veto legislation, was debated.[59] Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill.[60] Shortly afterwards, she left to visit her brother George in Corfu. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived only the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe.[61] She told Frederick Ponsonby, ""I feel as if I had been turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all.""[62] Later that year she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House, but she retained possession of Sandringham.[63] The new king, Alexandra\'s son George\xa0V, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported her son\'s reluctant agreement to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith\'s request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation.[64]', 'Alexandra retained a youthful appearance into her senior years,[69] but during the war her age caught up with her.[70] She took to wearing elaborate veils and heavy makeup, which was described by gossips as having her face ""enamelled"".[8] She made no more trips abroad, and her health worsened. In 1920, a blood vessel in her eye burst, leaving her with temporary partial blindness.[71] Towards the end of her life, her memory and speech became impaired.[72] She died on 20 November 1925 at Sandringham House from a heart attack eleven days before her 81st birthday. Queen Alexandra lay in state at Westminster Abbey and was interred on 28 November next to her husband in St George\'s Chapel, Windsor Castle.[1][73]', ""Alexandra has been portrayed on television by Deborah Grant and Helen Ryan in Edward the Seventh, Ann Firbank in Lillie, Maggie Smith in All the King's Men, and Bibi Andersson in The Lost Prince.

Anastasia and her siblings were taught to view Rasputin as ""Our Friend"" and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Anastasia\'s aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Anastasia, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. ""All the children seemed to like him,"" Olga Alexandrovna recalled. ""They were completely at ease with him.""[29] Rasputin\'s friendship with the imperial children was evident in some of the messages he sent to them. In February 1909, Rasputin sent the imperial children a telegram, advising them to ""Love the whole of God\'s nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.""[30]', 'In February 1917, Anastasia and her family were placed under house arrest at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo during the Russian Revolution.

She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus.""[23] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess ""offensive and a terrorist"" and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks.[50] Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.[51]', 'In the summer, the privations of the captivity, including their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family. On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, ""Something has happened to them in there.""[52] But the next day, on 15 July 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards were not watching. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, when he momentarily turned his back and left the room.[53]']"

Despite 17 pregnancies, she died without surviving issue and was the last monarch of the House of Stuart. Under the Act of Settlement 1701, which excluded all Catholics, she was succeeded by her second cousin George I of the House of Hanover.', ""Soon after their accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by granting him the Earldom of Marlborough and George was made Duke of Cumberland. Anne requested the use of Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused tension between the two sisters.[63] Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow George to serve in the military in an active capacity.[64] The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction.[65] From around this time,[66] at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman, respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone.[67] In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household.[68] Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset.[69] Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her.[70] In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again.[71] Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.[72]"", ""When Mary died of smallpox in 1694, William continued to reign alone. Anne became his heir apparent, since any children he might have by another wife were assigned to a lower place in the line of succession, and the two reconciled publicly. He restored her previous honours, allowed her to reside in St James's Palace,[73] and gave her Mary's jewels,[74] but excluded her from government and refrained from appointing her regent during his absences abroad.[75] Three months later, William restored Marlborough to his offices.[76] With Anne's restoration at court, Berkeley House became a social centre for courtiers who had previously avoided contact with Anne and her husband.[77]"", ""Anne's reign was marked by the further development of a two-party system. In general, the Tories were supportive of the Anglican church and favoured the landed interest of the country gentry, while the Whigs were aligned with commercial interests and Protestant Dissenters. As a committed Anglican, Anne was inclined to favour the Tories.[124] Her first ministry was predominantly Tory, and contained such High Tories as Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, and her uncle Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester.[125] It was headed by Lord Treasurer Lord Godolphin and Anne's favourite the Duke of Marlborough, who were considered moderate Tories, along with the Speaker of the House of Commons, Robert Harley.[126]"", 'The elder brother of Archduke Charles, Emperor Joseph I, died in April 1711 and Charles succeeded him in Austria, Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire. To also give him the Spanish throne was no longer in Britain\'s interests, but the proposed Peace of Utrecht submitted to Parliament for ratification did not go as far as the Whigs wanted to curb Bourbon ambitions.[176] In the House of Commons, the Tory majority was unassailable, but the same was not true in the House of Lords. The Whigs secured the support of the Earl of Nottingham against the treaty by promising to support his Occasional Conformity bill.[177] Seeing a need for decisive action to erase the anti-peace majority in the House of Lords, and seeing no alternative, Anne reluctantly created twelve new peers,[178] even though such a mass creation of peers was unprecedented.[179] Abigail\'s husband, Samuel Masham, was made a baron, although Anne protested to Harley that she ""never had any design to make a great lady of [Abigail], and should lose a useful servant"".[180] On the same day, Marlborough was dismissed as commander of the army.[181] The peace treaty was ratified and Britain\'s military involvement in the War of the Spanish Succession ended.[182]']"

Robert Cecil had considered other royal dowries, including those of Cecily of York, Mary Tudor, and Mary of France. Thomas Edmondes heard the settlement was ""as much, or rather more, than has been granted to any former King\'s wife"".[112] The manor of Topsham in Devon included admiralty rights at the port, and in July 1606 (after the sudden death of its owner) she obtained a cargo of tobacco from Venezuela.[113]', 'Anne enjoyed living in London, while James preferred to escape the capital, most often at his hunting lodge in Royston.[130] Anne\'s chaplain, Godfrey Goodman, later summed up the royal relationship: ""The King himself was a very chaste man, and there was little in the Queen to make him uxorious; yet they did love as well as man and wife could do, not conversing together.""[131] Anne moved into Greenwich Palace and then Somerset House, which she renamed Denmark House. After 1607, she and James rarely lived together,[132] by which time she had borne seven children and suffered at least three miscarriages. After narrowly surviving the birth and death of her last baby, Sophia, in 1607, Anne\'s decision to have no more children may have widened the gulf between her and James.[133]', 'Jones, a gifted architect steeped in the latest European taste, also designed the Queen\'s House at Greenwich for Anne, one of the first true Palladian buildings in England.[170] He designed ornamental gateways for her gardens and vineyard at Oatlands. The Sergeant Painter John de Critz decorated a fireplace in her ""tiring chamber"", her dressing room at Somerset House with various colours of marbling and imitation stone, and painted black and white marble in the chapel at Oatlands. In 1618 a passage at Somerset House was decorated with Renaissance style grotesque work, recorded as ""crotesque"".[171]', 'The diplomat Ralph Winwood obtained special greyhounds for her hunting from Jacob van den Eynde, Governor of Woerden.[172] The Dutch inventor Salomon de Caus laid out her gardens at Greenwich and Somerset House.[173] She had a barge for her journeys on the Thames, with glass windows.[174] Anne particularly loved music and patronised the lutenist and composer John Dowland,[175] previously employed at her brother\'s court in Denmark, as well as ""more than a good many"" French musicians.[176] Between 1607 and her death in 1619 she also employed the Irish harper Daniel Duff O\'Cahill.[177]', 'Although she danced at a Christmas masque, said to be ""a good sign of her convalescence"",[190] in January 1616 she moved from Whitehall Palace to Somerset House suffering from gout. King James planned to visit Scotland, and it was said that she dreamed of ruling England as regent in his absence.[191] The Earl of Dunfermline noted in February that ""her majesty looks very well, but yet I think is not perfectly well, she infrequently dresses, and keeps her bedchamber and a solitary life most times.""[192] James went to Scotland, while Anne stayed at Greenwich Palace and moved to Oatlands in June.[193] She was well enough to go hunting in August 1617.[194] By late 1617, Anne\'s bouts of illness had become debilitating; the letter writer John Chamberlain recorded: ""The Queen continues still ill disposed and though she would fain lay all her infirmities upon the gout yet most of her physicians fear a further inconvenience of an ill habit or disposition through her whole body.""[195]', 'In December 1617 the Venetian ambassador Piero Contarini had to wait a few days to get an audience with her because of illness. He described her appearance at Somerset House. She was seated under a canopy of gold brocade. Her costume was pink and gold, low cut at the front in an oval shape, and her farthingale was four feet wide. Her hair was dressed with diamonds and other jewels and extended in rays, or like the petals of a sunflower, with artificial hair. She had two little dogs who barked at the ambassador.[196] Contarini had a second audience with Anne in December and was led through private corridors in the palace by a richly dressed lady in waiting carrying a candle.[197]', 'On 9 April 1618 she was well enough to make a shopping trip incognito to the Royal Exchange, and was discovered, drawing a crowd of onlookers.[198] She had a nosebleed at Oatlands in September 1618 that confined her to bed and disrupted her travel plans.[199] Lucy, Countess of Bedford, thought it had weakened her, and she appeared ""dangerously ill"".[200] In November, a comet was interpreted as a portent of her death, but she was reported to be in good health and had watched a fox hunt from her bedroom window.[201] Lady Anne Clifford recorded that Anne was ill throughout Christmas and missed seeing masque performed at the Whitehall Banqueting House.[202]']"

Roño cast Aquino as a woman who begins a sexual relationship with her godson in the erotic drama Laro sa Baga (2000), the script of which she found risky but necessary for artistic growth. She considered her part to be challenging and an embodiment of ""physical and emotional transformation"".[16] The film required her to perform explicit sex scenes, including one in which she had to grab the genitals of co-star Carlos Morales.[16] Aquino\'s performance garnered critical acclaim; the Philippine Daily Inquirer\'s Pablo Tariman described her portrayal as ""superbly"" acted and one of the ""most riveting"" in the film.[17] Lito Zulueta, also from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, praised her ""sensitive"" delivery.[18] She won Best Supporting Actress at the Star Awards for Movies.[19] Aquino and Roño reunited in the action drama La Vida Rosa (2001), co-starring Rosanna Roces, Liza Lorena, and Jiro Manio, in which she played a mother whose daughter is abducted by her ex-boyfriend (played by Diether Ocampo).[20] The critic Andrew Paredes of the Manila Standard termed it a ""rare local film that stands taller than a Hollywood release"" and commended Aquino\'s ""wonderful, understated performance"".[21] That year, she starred in the daytime drama series Recuerdo de Amor (2001).[22] In February 2002, Aquino made her stage debut in a Folk Arts Theater production of Eve Ensler\'s play The Vagina Monologues, portraying a Bosnian woman subjected to rape.[23]', 'Following her theater appearance, Aquino featured in Mark Meily\'s critically acclaimed independent comedy-drama Crying Ladies, co-starring Sharon Cuneta and Hilda Koronel,[24][25] playing a professional mourner who has an affair with her friend\'s husband.[26] The film premiered at the 2003 Metro Manila Film Festival, where it won Best Picture.

Unlike her previous assignments, the role allowed her to display an intimidating and hysterical personality.[65] Aquino described her interpretation of Cruz as someone ""always upset with everyone, always screaming at the top of her lungs"", drawing inspiration from Agot Isidro\'s character in the television series Tayong Dalawa (2009). ""They\'ve designed the villainess\xa0... in such a way that they will be sympathetic also, that they will be as real as possible"", she said.[65] She found herself challenged by the role and said that working on the project was a ""daunting task"",[66] though she admitted that her personal experience working in the fashion industry drew her to the part.[65] Her performance received generally positive reviews,[67] with Ricky Lo of The Philippine Star finding Aquino to have ""reaffirmed her thespian chops"": ""Watching Vera Cruz is like riding a roller-coaster of powerful emotions. One minute you hate her, wanting to crush her into pieces\xa0... and the next you sympathize with her"".[68] She received a Star Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series nomination,[69] and was also nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category at the Asian Television Awards for the role.[70]', 'The year 2013 marked a high point in Aquino\'s career, as she was nominated for two Gawad Urian Awards in the same year.[80][81] She received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for the coming-of-age drama Ang Huling Cha-Cha ni Anita, in which she played a woman desired by a teenage girl. The director Sigrid Andrea Bernardo wanted Aquino\'s characterization to be distinctive and unorthodox, and thus asked her to dissociate from traditional portrayals of women she had done in the past. The film was screened at the 2013 CineFilipino Film Festival, and critic Bayani San Diego Jr. of the Philippine Daily Inquirer believed Aquino\'s supporting role particularly aided the narrative.[82] Her performance won the Best Supporting Actress award from the Gawad Urian,[83] the Star Awards,[84] the Golden Screen Awards,[85] and the Gawad Tanglaw.[86] Her second Gawad Urian nomination that year came from the independent drama Porno, playing a transgender woman with a pornography addiction. Portraying the part proved difficult for Aquino, who found working on the film ""nauseating but fulfilling"". She added, ""Just the idea, it\'s hard to swallow for me [because I am not a man]"".[80] Earl Villanueva of the Philippine Entertainment Portal was enthusiastic about the film\'s ""bold, shocking"" production and described Aquino as a stand out: in his opinion, she conveyed a credible quality that her role required.[87]', 'Throughout her career, Aquino has received many accolades for her work in film and television. She received a Star Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performances in Laro sa Baga and Ang Huling Cha-Cha ni Anita.[19][80] For the latter film, she was also awarded the Gawad Urian,[83] Gawad Tanglaw,[86] Golden Screen,[85] and Star Award in the same category.[84] In addition, for her role in the television series Apoy sa Dagat, she was awarded a Golden Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress.[89] She has received double nominations at the Gawad Urian Awards in the same year, similar to performers such as John Lloyd Cruz, Anne Curtis, and Eddie Garcia.[80][171][172]']"

In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994, he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged in a series of negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. The success of the negotiations in Oslo led to Arafat being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, alongside Israeli Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, in 1994. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.[8][9][10]"", 'In the late 1960s, tensions between Palestinians and the Jordanian government increased greatly; heavily armed Palestinian elements had created a virtual ""state within a state"" in Jordan, eventually controlling several strategic positions in that country. After their proclaimed victory in the Battle of Karameh, Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan. They set up roadblocks, publicly humiliated Jordanian police forces, molested women and levied illegal taxes—all of which Arafat either condoned or ignored.[38] King Hussein considered this a growing threat to his kingdom\'s sovereignty and security, and attempted to disarm the militias. However, in order to avoid a military confrontation with opposition forces, Hussein dismissed several of his anti-PLO cabinet officials, including some of his own family members, and invited Arafat to become Deputy Prime Minister of Jordan. Arafat refused, citing his belief in the need for a Palestinian state with Palestinian leadership.[56]', ""Prior to signing the accords, Arafat—as Chairman of the PLO and its official representative—signed two letters renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel. In return, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, on behalf of Israel, officially recognized the PLO.[102] The following year, Arafat and Rabin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Shimon Peres.[103] The Palestinian reaction was mixed. The Rejectionist Front of the PLO allied itself with Islamists in a common opposition against the agreements. It was rejected also by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan as well as by many Palestinian intellectuals and the local leadership of the Palestinian territories. However, the inhabitants of the territories generally accepted the agreements and Arafat's promise for peace and economic well-being.[104]"", 'In 1994, Arafat moved to Gaza City, which was controlled by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)—the provisional entity created by the Oslo Accords.[103] Arafat became the President and Prime Minister of the PNA, the Commander of the PLA and the Speaker of the PLC. In July, after the PNA was declared the official government of the Palestinians, the Basic Laws of the Palestinian National Authority was published,[106] in three different versions by the PLO. Arafat proceeded with creating a structure for the PNA. He established an executive committee or cabinet composed of twenty members. Arafat also replaced and assigned mayors and city councils for major cities such as Gaza and Nablus. He began subordinating non-governmental organizations that worked in education, health, and social affairs under his authority by replacing their elected leaders and directors with PNA officials loyal to him. He then appointed himself chairman of the Palestinian financial organization that was created by the World Bank to control most aid money towards helping the new Palestinian entity.[104]', 'In mid-1996, Benjamin Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister of Israel. Palestinian-Israeli relations grew even more hostile as a result of continued conflict.[111] Despite the Israel-PLO accord, Netanyahu opposed the idea of Palestinian statehood.[112] In 1998, US President Bill Clinton persuaded the two leaders to meet. The resulting Wye River Memorandum detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and PNA to complete the peace process.[113]', ""Arafat was finally allowed to leave his compound on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations led to a settlement: six PFLP militants, including the organization's secretary-general Ahmad Sa'adat, wanted by Israel, who had been holed up with Arafat in his compound, would be transferred to international custody in Jericho. After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted.[127] With that, and a promise that he would issue a call to the Palestinians to halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. He issued such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat.[128][129][130] In March 2003, Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US.[131]""]"

Following her mother's death in 1901, she entered the social circle established by her elder brother, the new king, Edward VII. Louise's marriage with Lorne survived thanks to long periods of separation; they reconciled in 1911, and Louise was devastated by Lorne's death in 1914. After the First World War she began to retire from public life, undertaking few public duties outside Kensington Palace, where she died at the age of 91."", 'From her early years, Louise was a talented and intelligent child, and her artistic talents were quickly recognised.[8] On his visit to Osborne House in 1863, Hallam Tennyson, the son of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, remarked that Louise could ""draw beautifully"".[9] Because of her royal rank, an artistic career was not considered. However, the queen first allowed her to attend art school under the tutelage of the sculptor Mary Thornycroft, and later (1863) allowed her to study at the National Art Training School, now The Royal College of Art.[3] Louise also became an able dancer, and Victoria wrote, after a dance, that Louise ""danced the sword dance with more verve and accuracy than any of her sisters"".[10] Her wit and intelligence made her a favourite with her father,[11] with her inquisitive nature earning her the nickname ""Little Miss Why"" from other members of the royal family.[10]', ""Louise's father, Prince Albert, died at Windsor on 14 December 1861. The queen was devastated, and ordered her household to move from Windsor to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The atmosphere of the royal court became gloomy and morbid in the wake of the prince's death, and entertainments became dry and dull.[12] Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother's prolonged mourning.[12] For her seventeenth birthday in 1865, Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a debutante dance, the like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert's death. Her request was refused, and her boredom with the mundane routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother, who considered Louise to be indiscreet and argumentative.[3]"", ""The queen comforted herself by rigidly continuing with Prince Albert's plans for their children. Princess Alice was married to Prince Louis, the future Grand Duke of Hesse, at Osborne House on 1 July 1862. In 1863, Edward, the Prince of Wales, married Princess Alexandra of Denmark. The queen made it a tradition that the eldest unmarried daughter become her unofficial secretary, a position which Louise filled in 1866 following the marriage of her elder sister Helena, despite the queen's concern that she was indiscreet.[12]"", ""The couple's official place of residence was Rosneath House in Dumbartonshire.[33]"", 'In 1878, British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli nominated Lorne to be Canada\'s Governor General, and he was duly appointed by Queen Victoria.[34] Louise thus became his viceregal consort. \nAs viceregal consort, she used her position to support the arts and higher education and the cause of female equality, although she said ""the subject of Domestic Economy lies at the root of the – highest life of every true woman.""[35] But her stay in Canada was unhappy as a result of homesickness, dislike of Ottawa and a bad sleighing accident.[3]', ""Louise resumed public duties in Britain, for example, opening St George's Gardens, Bloomsbury on 1 July 1884.[61] and Lorne his political career, campaigning unsuccessfully for the Hampstead seat in 1885. In 1896, he won the South Manchester seat, entering parliament as a Liberal. Louise, unlike Lorne and his father, was in favour of Irish Home Rule, and disappointed when he defected from Gladstonian Liberalism to the Liberal Unionists.[62] Relations between Louise and Lorne were strained, and, despite the queen's attempts to keep them under one roof, they often went their separate ways.[63] Even when he accompanied Louise, he was not always received with favour at court, and the Prince of Wales did not take to him.[64] Out of all the royal family, Lorne was the only one to be identified closely with a political party, having been a Gladstonian liberal in the House of Commons.[36]"", ""Louise and her sisters had another disagreement after the death of the queen's close friend, Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill. Determined not to put her mother through more misery, Louise wanted the news to be broken to the queen gradually. When this was not done, Louise voiced sharp criticism of Helena and Beatrice.[84] One month later, on 22 January 1901, Queen Victoria died at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.[85] In her will, the queen bequeathed Kent House, on the Osborne Estate, to Louise as a country residence,[86] and gave Osborne Cottage to Louise's youngest sister, Beatrice. Louise and Beatrice were now neighbours both at Kensington Palace and Osborne.[87]"", 'Upon Queen Victoria\'s death, Louise entered the social circle of her brother, the new King Edward VII, with whom she had much in common, including smoking.[88] She had an obsession with physical fitness, and if she was sneered at for this, she would retort by saying: ""Never mind, I\'ll outlive you all.""[89] Meanwhile, Louise\'s husband, 9th Duke of Argyll since 1900, took his seat in the House of Lords. The Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, offered him the office of Governor-General of Australia that year, but the offer was declined.[36] Louise continued her sculpture, and in 1902, designed a memorial to the colonial soldiers who died in the Boer War.[90] In the same year, she began a nude study of a married woman suggested by the English painter Sir William Blake Richmond.[90]', ""Louise spent much of her time at Kent House, and she frequently visited Scotland with her husband. Financial pressures did not disappear when Lorne became Duke, and Louise avoided inviting the King to Inveraray, Argyll's ancestral home, because the couple were economising.

He served as quartermaster general of the New York Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, he devoted more time to New York Republican politics and quickly rose in Senator Roscoe Conkling's political organization. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him as Collector of the Port of New York in 1871, and he was an important supporter of Conkling and the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party. In 1878, following bitter disputes between Conkling and President Rutherford B. Hayes over control of patronage in New York, Hayes fired Arthur as part of a plan to reform the federal patronage system. In June 1880, the extended contest between Grant, identified with the Stalwarts, and James G. Blaine, the candidate of the Half-Breed faction, led to the compromise selection of Ohio's Garfield for president. Republicans then nominated Arthur for vice president to balance the ticket geographically and to placate Stalwarts disappointed by Grant's defeat.

Arthur vetoed the first version of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, arguing that its twenty-year ban on Chinese immigrants to the United States violated the Burlingame Treaty, but he signed a second version, which included a ten-year ban.[3] He appointed Horace Gray and Samuel Blatchford to the Supreme Court. He also enforced the Immigration Act of 1882 to impose more restrictions on immigrants and the Tariff of 1883 to attempt to reduce tariffs. Arthur signed into law the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which came as a surprise to reformers who held a negative reputation of Arthur as a Stalwart and product of Conkling's organization."", 'Suffering from poor health, Arthur made only a limited effort to secure the Republican Party\'s nomination in 1884, and he retired at the end of his term. Arthur\'s failing health and political temperament combined to make his administration less active than a modern presidency, yet he earned praise among contemporaries for his solid performance in office.

When Arthur was nominated for vice president in 1880, a New York attorney and political opponent, Arthur P. Hinman, initially speculated that Arthur was born in Ireland and did not come to the United States until he was 14 years old.[30] Had that been true, opponents might have argued that Arthur was ineligible for the vice presidency under the United States Constitution's natural-born-citizen clause.[31][d][32][e][33] When Hinman's original story did not take root, he spread a new rumor that Arthur was born in Canada.[30] This claim, too, failed to gain credence.[33][f][34]"", 'Arthur spent some of his childhood years living in the New York towns of York, Perry, Greenwich, Lansingburgh, Schenectady, and Hoosick.[35] One of his first teachers said Arthur was a boy ""frank and open in manners and genial in disposition"".[36] During his time at school, he gained his first political inclinations and supported the Whig Party. He joined other young Whigs in support of Henry Clay, even participating in a brawl against students who supported James K. Polk during the 1844 United States presidential election.[20] Arthur also supported the Fenian Brotherhood, an Irish republican organization founded in America; he showed this support by wearing a green coat.[37] After completing his college preparation at the Lyceum of Union Village (now Greenwich) and a grammar school in Schenectady, Arthur enrolled at Union College there in 1845, where he studied the traditional classical curriculum.[20] He was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity,[38] and as a senior he was president of the debate society and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.[37] During his winter breaks, he served as a teacher at a school in Schaghticoke.[37]', ""Arthur's political prospects improved along with his law practice when his patron, ex-Governor Morgan, was elected to the United States Senate.[60] He was hired by Thomas Murphy, a Republican politician, but also a friend of William M.

Blaine, a senator from Maine who was more amenable to civil service reform.[108] Neither candidate commanded a majority of delegates and, deadlocked after thirty-six ballots, the convention turned to a dark horse, James A. Garfield, an Ohio Congressman and Civil War general who was neither Stalwart nor Half-Breed.[109]', 'Garfield and his supporters knew they would face a difficult election without the support of the New York Stalwarts and decided to offer one of them the vice presidential nomination.[110] Levi P. Morton, the first choice of Garfield\'s supporters, consulted with Conkling, who advised him to decline, which he did.[111] They next approached Arthur, and Conkling advised him to also reject the nomination, believing the Republicans would lose.[112] Arthur thought otherwise and accepted. According to a purported eyewitness account by journalist William C. Hudson, Conkling and Arthur argued, with Arthur telling Conkling, ""The office of the Vice-President is a greater honor than I ever dreamed of attaining.""[112][j] Conkling eventually relented, and campaigned for the ticket.[115]', ""After the election, Arthur worked in vain to persuade Garfield to fill certain positions with his fellow New York Stalwarts—especially that of the Secretary of the Treasury; the Stalwart machine received a further rebuke when Garfield appointed Blaine, Conkling's arch-enemy, as Secretary of State.[122] The running mates, never close, detached as Garfield continued to freeze out the Stalwarts from his patronage. Arthur's status in the administration diminished when, a month before inauguration day, he gave a speech before reporters suggesting the election in Indiana, a swing state, had been won by Republicans through illegal machinations.[123] Garfield ultimately appointed a Stalwart, Thomas Lemuel James, to be Postmaster General, but the cabinet fight and Arthur's ill-considered speech left the President and Vice President clearly estranged when they took office on March 4, 1881.[124]"", ""After the election, Arthur worked in vain to persuade Garfield to fill certain positions with his fellow New York Stalwarts—especially that of the Secretary of the Treasury; the Stalwart machine received a further rebuke when Garfield appointed Blaine, Conkling's arch-enemy, as Secretary of State.[122] The running mates, never close, detached as Garfield continued to freeze out the Stalwarts from his patronage.

Platt, resigned in protest of Garfield's continuing opposition to their faction.[127]"", 'While in Albany on July 2, Arthur learned that Garfield had been shot.[128] The assassin, Charles J.

He asked the cabinet members to remain until December, when Congress would reconvene, but Treasury Secretary William Windom submitted his resignation in October to enter a Senate race in his home state of Minnesota.[140] Arthur then selected Charles J. Folger, his friend and fellow New York Stalwart as Windom's replacement.[140][n] Attorney General Wayne MacVeagh was next to resign, believing that, as a reformer, he had no place in an Arthur cabinet.[142] Despite Arthur's personal appeal to remain, MacVeagh resigned in December 1881 and Arthur replaced him with Benjamin H. Brewster, a Philadelphia lawyer and machine politician reputed to have reformist leanings.[142] Blaine, nemesis of the Stalwart faction, remained Secretary of State until Congress reconvened and then departed immediately.[143] Conkling expected Arthur to appoint him in Blaine's place, but the President chose Frederick T. Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, a Stalwart recommended by ex-President Grant.[143] Frelinghuysen advised Arthur not to fill any future vacancies with Stalwarts, but when Postmaster General James resigned in January 1882, Arthur selected Timothy O. Howe, a Wisconsin Stalwart.[144] Navy Secretary William H. Hunt was next to resign, in April 1882, and Arthur attempted a more balanced approach by appointing Half-Breed William E. Chandler to the post, on Blaine's recommendation.[144] Finally, when Interior Secretary Samuel J. Kirkwood resigned that same month, Arthur appointed Henry M. Teller, a Colorado Stalwart to the office.[144] Of the Cabinet members Arthur had inherited from Garfield, only Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln remained for the entirety of Arthur's term.[144]\nArthur could not appoint a new vice president to fill the vacancy, as this was prior to the 25th Amendment to the Constitution."", ""Garfield's assassination by a deranged office seeker amplified the public demand for civil service reform.[149] Both Democratic and Republican leaders realized that they could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system and, by 1882, a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform.[149] In 1880, Democratic Senator George H. Pendleton of Ohio introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination.[149] This legislation greatly expanded similar civil service reforms attempted by President Franklin Pierce 30 years earlier. In his first annual presidential address to Congress in 1881, Arthur requested civil service reform legislation and Pendleton again introduced his bill, but Congress did not pass it.[149] Republicans lost seats in the 1882 congressional elections, in which Democrats campaigned on the reform issue.[150] As a result, the lame-duck session of Congress was more amenable to civil service reform; the Senate approved Pendleton's bill 38–5 and the House soon concurred by a vote of 155–47.[151] Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January 16, 1883.[151] In just two years' time, an unrepentant Stalwart had become the president who ushered in long-awaited civil service reform.[151]"", ""During the Garfield administration, Secretary of State James G. Blaine attempted to invigorate United States diplomacy in Latin America, urging reciprocal trade agreements and offering to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations.[162] Blaine, venturing a greater involvement in affairs south of the Rio Grande, proposed a Pan-American conference in 1882 to discuss trade and an end to the War of the Pacific being fought by Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.[162] Blaine did not remain in office long enough to see the effort through, and when Frederick T. Frelinghuysen replaced him at the end of 1881, the conference efforts lapsed.[163] Frelinghuysen also discontinued Blaine's peace efforts in the War of the Pacific, fearing that the United States might be drawn into the conflict.[163] Arthur and Frelinghuysen continued Blaine's efforts to encourage trade among the nations of the Western Hemisphere; a treaty with Mexico providing for reciprocal tariff reductions was signed in 1882 and approved by the Senate in 1884.[164] Legislation required to bring the treaty into force failed in the House, however, rendering it a dead letter.[164] Similar efforts at reciprocal trade treaties with Santo Domingo and Spain's American colonies were defeated by February 1885, and an existing reciprocity treaty with the Kingdom of Hawaii was allowed to lapse.[165]"", 'The 47th Congress spent a great deal of time on immigration, and at times was in accord with Arthur.[166] In July 1882 Congress easily passed a bill regulating steamships that carried immigrants to the United States.[166] To their surprise, Arthur vetoed it and requested revisions, which they made and Arthur then approved.[166] He also signed in August of that year the Immigration Act of 1882, which levied a 50-cent tax on immigrants to the United States, and excluded from entry the mentally ill, the intellectually disabled, criminals, or any other person potentially dependent upon public assistance.[167]', 'A more contentious debate materialized over the status of Chinese immigrants; in January 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese into the country.

Miller of California introduced another Chinese Exclusion Act that blocked entry of Chinese laborers for a twenty-year period.[169] The bill passed the Senate and House by overwhelming margins, but this as well was vetoed by Arthur, who concluded the 20-year ban to be a breach of the renegotiated treaty of 1880.

Hunt advocated reform of the Navy.[174]"", ""Arthur made appointments to fill two vacancies on the United States Supreme Court. The first vacancy arose in July 1881 with the death of Associate Justice Nathan Clifford, a Democrat who had been a member of the Court since before the Civil War.[201] Arthur nominated Horace Gray, a distinguished jurist from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to replace him, and the nomination was easily confirmed.[201] Gray would serve on the Court for over 20 years until resigning in 1902.[202] The second vacancy occurred when Associate Justice Ward Hunt retired in January 1882. Arthur first nominated his old political boss, Roscoe Conkling; he doubted that Conkling would accept, but felt obligated to offer a high office to his former patron.[201] The Senate confirmed the nomination but, as expected, Conkling declined it,[201] the last time a confirmed nominee declined an appointment.[203] Senator George Edmunds was Arthur's next choice, but he declined to be considered.[204] Instead, Arthur nominated Samuel Blatchford, who had been a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for the prior four years.[201] Blatchford accepted, and his nomination was approved by the Senate within two weeks.[201] Blatchford served on the Court until his death in 1893."", 'Arthur left office in 1885 and returned to his New York City home. Two months before the end of his term, several New York Stalwarts approached him to request that he run for United States Senate, but he declined, preferring to return to his old law practice at Arthur, Knevals & Ransom.[205] His health limited his activity with the firm, and Arthur served only of counsel.

He was the adopted son of King Eumenes I, whom he succeeded, and was the first of the Attalid dynasty to assume the title of king, sometime around 240 to 235\xa0BC.  He was the son of Attalus and his wife Antiochis."", 'Attalus styled himself as a protector of the freedoms of the Greek cities of Anatolia as well as the champion of Greeks against barbarians. He funded art and monuments in Pergamon and in Greek cities he sought to cultivate as allies.  He died in 197\xa0BC at the age of 72, shortly before the end of the second war, having suffered an apparent stroke while addressing a Boeotian war council some months before. He and his wife Apollonis were admired for their rearing of their four sons.  He was succeeded as king by his son Eumenes II.', ""Little is known about Attalus' early life. He was Greek and the son of Attalus and Antiochis.[4] His father Attalus was the son of a brother (also called Attalus) of both Philetaerus, the founder of the Attalid dynasty, and Eumenes, the father of Eumenes I, Philetaerus' successor.[5]  The elder Attalus is recorded, along with his uncles, as providing generous donations to Delphi.[6]  His father also won fame as a charioteer, winning at Olympia, and was honored with a monument at Pergamon.  It is conjectured the elder Attalus might have been considered a potential successor to Philetaerus, but Eumenes I succeeded to the throne instead.  Attalus' mother Antiochis was probably related to the Seleucid royal family (perhaps a granddaughter of Seleucus I Nicator) with her marriage to Attalus' father likely arranged by Philetaerus to solidify his power.[7]"", 'Little is known of the early reign of Attalus. The main recorded event of the era was a battle with the Galatians.[9]   According to the 2nd century AD Greek writer Pausanias, ""the greatest of his achievements"" was the defeat of the ""Gauls"" (Γαλάται).[10] The Galatians were immigrant Celts from Thrace, who had recently settled in Galatia in central Asia Minor, and whom the Romans and Greeks called Gauls, associating them with the Celts of what is now France, Switzerland, and northern Italy. Since the time of Philetaerus, the first Attalid ruler, the Galatians had posed a problem for Pergamon, indeed for all of Asia Minor, by exacting tributes to avoid war or other repercussions. Eumenes I had (probably), along with other rulers, dealt with the Galatians by paying these tributes. Attalus however refused to pay them, being the first such ruler recorded to do so.[11] As a consequence, the Galatians set out to attack Pergamon, sometime around 238–235\xa0BC.[12] Attalus met them near the sources of the river Caicus and decisively won the resulting Battle of the Caecus River.[13]', 'The prestige gained by the victory caused Attalus to take the surname of Soter, ""savior"", following the example of Antiochus I.  He also declared himself basileus, king.  While this did not increase his practical authority as his adopted father had already ruled like a king, it formally severed any relationship with the Seleucid Empire\'s king as a superior suzerain.[14] The victory would be the core element of Attalus\'s reputation and fame.  Attalus presented himself as the victorious champion of Greeks against barbarians, and commissioned much artwork and sculptures commemorating himself and the Pergamene victory.[15]', ""While affairs in the east of his kingdom occupied much of his early reign, the west of Attalus's domain became more active later on.  Attalus had sometime before 219\xa0BC become allied with the Aetolian League, a union of Greek states in Aetolia in central Greece.  He helped fund the fortification of Elaeus, an Aetolian stronghold in Calydonia, near the mouth of the river Acheloos.  This would later bring Attalus into conflict with Philip V of Macedon, king of Antigonid Macedonia and the preeminent power in the Aegean Sea region, in what would eventually become the First Macedonian War.[30]  Attalus sought to burnish his regional reputation, more so than many of his contemporary rulers.  In addition to fortifications, Attalus also funded art and monuments, such as a stoa at Delphi (then part of the Aetolian League).[31]"", 'In 205\xa0BC, following the Peace of Phoenice, Rome turned to Attalus, as its only friend in Asia, for help concerning a religious matter.  The Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage was still continuing.  A consultation of the Sibylline Books found verses saying that if a foreigner were to make war on Italy, he could be defeated if the Mater Deum Magna Idaea, the Great Mother Goddess, was brought to Rome.  Additionally, an unusual number of meteor showers had been seen.  The interpretation of the oracle of Delphi was that Rome needed to start a cult in Rome to this Mother Goddess to win the war.[42]', 'A Roman delegation, led by M. Valerius Laevinus, was dispatched to Pergamon to seek Attalus\' aid in gaining an appropriate artifact to bring to Rome. According to Livy, Attalus received the delegation warmly, and ""handed over to them the sacred stone which the natives declared to be \'the Mother of the Gods\', and bade them carry it to Rome.""[43] The ancient Phyrgian goddess Cybele was thus introduced to Rome as the Magna Mater, and the Mother of Gods stone was said itself to be meteoric.[42]', ""One aspect of the account which varies in sources is where exactly the stone came from.  While Ovid's version says the Mother of Gods was found on Mount Ida, close to Pergamon, most other accounts say it came from Pessinus, which was far inland: a place where Pergamene influence was weak at best and Gallic influence was strong.

Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to consecrate 12 suffragan bishops as soon as possible and to send a bishop to York. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at London, with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop. As part of this plan, Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury. This move never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason,[45] but it was probably because London was not part of Æthelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the kingdom of Essex, ruled by Æthelberht's nephew Saebert of Essex, who converted to Christianity in 604.[18][46] The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of Æthelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see.

Truman. In 1905, he was elected to local offices and in 1912 as a U.S. representative. Serving in both houses of Congress, he was a liberal Democrat, supporting President Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom domestic agenda and foreign policy.[1]"", 'Endorsing Prohibition and denouncing parimutuel betting, Barkley narrowly lost the Kentucky Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1923 to fellow representative J. Campbell Cantrill. In 1926, he unseated Republican senator Richard P. Ernst. In the Senate, he supported the New Deal approach to handling the Great Depression in the United States. Democrats chose him to succeed Senate Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson upon Robinson\'s death in 1937. His 1938 re-election bid was an intense, bitter victory against Governor A. B. ""Happy"" Chandler.[2] When World War II focused President Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s attention on foreign affairs, Barkley gained influence over the administration\'s domestic agenda. He resigned as floor leader after Roosevelt ignored his advice and vetoed the Revenue Act of 1943.[3] The veto was overridden by both houses and the Democratic senators unanimously re-elected Barkley to the position of Majority Leader.', ""Willie Alben Barkley, the eldest of eight children of John Wilson Barkley (1854–1932) and Electa Eliza (Smith) Barkley (1858–1945), was born November 24, 1877.[6][7] His grandmother, midwife Amanda Barkley, delivered him in the log house she lived in with her husband, Alben, in Wheel, Kentucky.[8] Barkley's parents were tenant farmers who grew tobacco, and his father was an elder in the local Presbyterian church.[9] Barkley traced his father's ancestry to Scots-Irish Presbyterians in Rowan County, North Carolina.[10] Both parents were religious, opposed to playing cards and alcohol.[9] Occasionally, Barkley's parents would leave him in the care of his grandparents for extended periods.[11] During these times, his grandmother related stories of her relatives. Her childhood playmates included future U.S. Vice President Adlai Stevenson\xa0I and James A. McKenzie, a future U.S. representative from Kentucky.[11]"", 'In the Senate, Barkley was assigned to the Committee on the Library, and the committees on Finance and Banking and Currency; later, he was added to the Commerce Committee.[87] In early 1928, Vice President Charles G. Dawes assigned him to a special committee to investigate the campaign expenditures of the leading candidates in the upcoming presidential election.[87]', 'Supporting Roosevelt\'s provision of aid to Allied Powers during World War II, Barkley sponsored the Lend-Lease Act in the Senate.[136] In November 1943, he helped draft the Connally–Fulbright Resolution for the creation of an international peace-keeping body at the end of the war, an idea he had favored since Woodrow Wilson\'s support of the League of Nations.[136] Supreme Court Justice and fellow Kentuckian Louis Brandeis influenced Barkley to adopt Zionism; during and after the war, Barkley advocated creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and introduced a 1943 resolution demanding that the Nazis be punished for persecuting Jews.[24][136] U.S. entry into the war diverted Roosevelt\'s attention away from domestic affairs.[111] Vice President Wallace, House Speaker Sam Rayburn, Democratic House Floor Leader John William McCormack, and Barkley – the president\'s ""Big Four"" – helped develop and pass the administration\'s legislative agenda.[111] Barkley regularly met with the chairmen of the Senate\'s standing committees, forming a sort of legislative cabinet.[136] With their support, he secured passage of the War Powers Act and the Emergency Price Control Act.[137] He also advocated passage of a measure to outlaw poll taxes, but the bill was defeated.[138]', 'In April 1943 a confidential analysis by Isaiah Berlin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office described Barkley as ""a Democratic party \'wheelhorse\' who will pull the Administration wagon through thick and thin. Although he is the Majority Leader in the Senate, he is not an adroit negotiator, but a loyal supporter of the President come hell or high water.""[139]', ""Barkley was among 12 nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be Roosevelt's running mate in the presidential election that year, receiving six votes.[142] Delegates favored replacing Vice President Henry Wallace on their ticket in favor of Barkley, but Roosevelt refused to consider him, telling a July 11 meeting of Democratic leaders that he was too old.[111][143] Instead, he took the recommendation of Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan and chose Harry S. Truman.[143] Despite his differences with Roosevelt, Barkley faced no serious challengers in the 1944 Democratic primary and defeated his Republican challenger, Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney James Park, by a vote of 464,053 to 380,425.[144]"", 'In an upset victory, Truman and Barkley were elected over the Republican ticket by over 2\xa0million votes, and Democrats regained majorities in both houses of Congress.[156] 71 years old at the time of his inauguration, he was (and still is) the oldest man ever elected vice president, breaking Charles Curtis\' record at 69.[44][157] His grandson, Stephen M. Truitt, suggested the nickname ""Veep"" as an alternative to ""Mr. Vice President"".[158] The nickname was used by the press, but Barkley\'s successor, Richard Nixon, discontinued using it, saying it belonged to Barkley.[157]', 'At the March 29, 1952 Jefferson–Jackson Day fundraiser, Truman announced that he would not seek re-election, although he was exempt from the Twenty-second Amendment\'s term limits.[175] After the announcement, the District of Columbia Democratic Club formed a Barkley for President Club with Iowa senator Guy Gillette as chairman.[174] Prominent Kentuckians – including senator Earle C. Clements, governor Lawrence Wetherby, and lieutenant governor Emerson ""Doc"" Beauchamp – supported the candidacy.[174] Exactly two months after Truman\'s announcement, Barkley declared his availability to run for president while maintaining he was not actively seeking the office.[176]', 'He re-entered politics in 1954, challenging incumbent Republican senator John Sherman Cooper.[185] In a 1971 study of Barkley\'s Senate career, historian Glenn Finch argued that Barkley was the only person who could beat Cooper.[186] Few issues differentiated the candidates, and the campaign hinged on party politics; visits to Kentucky by President Eisenhower, Vice President Richard Nixon, and Illinois senator Everett Dirksen on Cooper\'s behalf reinforced this notion.[184] Barkley resumed his Iron Man campaign style, campaigning for up to sixteen hours a day, countering the ""too old"" charge that had cost him the 1952 Democratic presidential nomination.[187] He won the general election by a vote of 434,109 (56%) to 362,948 (46%), giving Democrats a one-vote advantage in the Senate.[161][183]', ""Veteran West Virginia senator Harley M. Kilgore offered to exchange seats with Barkley, putting Barkley on the front row with the chamber's senior members and himself on the back row with the freshman legislators, but Barkley declined the offer.[188] In honor of his previous service, he was assigned to the prestigious Committee on Foreign Relations.[44] In this position, he endorsed Eisenhower's appointment of Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal.[188] His relative lack of seniority did not afford him much influence.[188] Barkley did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto despite school segregation being legally required in Kentucky prior to Brown v.

After four years in private life, he returned to the diplomatic arena as Ambassador to Great Britain.', ""Born in Delaware to a prominent family, Bayard learned politics from his father James A. Bayard Jr., who also served in the Senate. In 1869, the Delaware legislature elected Bayard to the Senate upon his father's retirement.  A Peace Democrat during the Civil War, Bayard spent his early years in the Senate in opposition to Republican policies, especially the Reconstruction of the defeated Confederate states. His conservatism extended to financial matters as he became known as a staunch supporter of the gold standard and an opponent of greenbacks and silver coinage which he believed would cause inflation. Bayard's conservative politics made him popular in the Southern United States and with financial interests in the Eastern United States, but never popular enough to obtain the Democratic nomination for president which he attempted to win in 1876, 1880 and 1884."", 'In 1885, President Cleveland appointed Bayard Secretary of State. Bayard worked with Cleveland to promote American trade in the Pacific while avoiding the acquisition of colonies at a time when many Americans clamored for them. He sought increased cooperation with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, working to resolve disputes over fishing and seal-hunting rights in the waters around the Canada–United States border. As ambassador, Bayard continued to strive for Anglo-American friendship. This brought him into conflict with his successor at the State Department Richard Olney, when Olney and Cleveland demanded more aggressive diplomatic overtures than Bayard wished in the Venezuelan crisis of 1895. His term at the American embassy ended in 1897 and he died the following year.', ""In 1846, his father secured him a job in a banking firm in Philadelphia, and he worked there for the next two years.[4] Bayard was unsatisfied with his progress at the firm and returned to Wilmington to read law at his father's office.[4] Bayard was admitted to the bar in 1851,[5] the year that his father was elected to the U.S. Senate.[b] Thomas took on greater responsibilities in the family law office and rose quickly in the legal profession.[6] In 1853, after the election of Democratic President Franklin Pierce, Bayard was appointed United States Attorney for Delaware.[7] He spent only a year in the position before moving to Philadelphia to open a law practice with his friend William Shippen, a partnership that lasted until Shippen's death in 1858.[7] While in Philadelphia, Bayard met Louise Lee, whom he married in October 1856. The marriage produced twelve children.[8]"", ""Bayard and his father continued in private law practice through the war.  Both were pleased with the Democrats' peace platform in 1864, but disappointed in the choice of nominee, Major General George B. McClellan, a War Democrat.[17]  In 1866, Thomas Bayard successfully represented four South Carolinians in habeas corpus cases against the military.[18]  The following year, Senator George R. Riddle died and the legislature elected James Bayard to fill the remainder of the term, which ended in 1869.[18][c] Bayard became more politically active, speaking at a public meeting in September 1867 against constitutional proposals for ending racial discrimination in voting rights.[20]  The following year, he condemned the impeachment proceedings against President Andrew Johnson, who had succeeded to the presidency in 1865 after Lincoln's assassination and had threatened the Republican Congress's plans for Reconstruction of the Southern states.[20]  Both Bayards attended the 1868 Democratic National Convention and, although they were unenthusiastic about the nominee, Horatio Seymour, supported the unsuccessful ticket that year.[21]"", ""As more Democrats returned to the Senate, and as Republican goals shifted elsewhere, Bayard's ideas gained some traction, but were still largely in vain.  In 1873, the Senate passed a resolution he introduced that demanded that Grant disclose how much government money was being expended in enforcing Reconstruction laws in the South, and to whom it was paid; the President ignored the resolution.[29]  The next year, Bayard opposed a Republican bill authorizing federal supervision of the upcoming election in Louisiana, attacking the Republican administration there as corrupt; he was unsuccessful, and the election was supervised by federal troops.[30]  He spoke forcefully against the proposed Civil Rights Act of 1875, which was to be the last such act for nearly a century.  Again, he was unsuccessful and the bill, which guaranteed equal treatment in public accommodations regardless of race, passed Congress and became law.[d][31]  Although ultimately unsuccessful, Bayard's actions endeared him to his conservative constituents, and he was elected to another six-year term in 1874.[31]"", ""On election day, the vote was close, but appeared to favor a Tilden victory.[42] Three days later, Tilden looked to have won 184 electoral votes, one short of a majority, while Hayes appeared to have 166 votes, with the votes of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina still in doubt.[e][43] Each party sent their people to observe the vote in the disputed states.  Abram Hewitt, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, asked Bayard to travel to Louisiana along with several others, but Bayard refused to go.[44] The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, with each state producing two sets of returns, one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man.  There was debate about which person or house of Congress was authorized to decide between the competing slates of electors, with the Republican Senate and the Democratic House each claiming priority.[45] By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes.[45]  Bayard supported the idea, and visited Tilden in New York to convince him that it was the only alternative to stalemate and possible renewed civil war.[46]  The bill passed, with Bayard's vote, and provided for a commission of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices.[47]"", ""In short, silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents, and receive back a silver dollar. William B. Allison, a pro-silver Republican from Iowa, offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver, but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints.[61] Thus, the seignorage, or difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it accrued to the government's credit, not private citizens.  Bayard saw the whole effort as the path to inflation and economic ruin.[62]  Again, he spoke against the bill, but like the Matthews resolution, the Bland–Allison Act passed both houses of Congress in 1878.  President Hayes shared Bayard's fear of inflation, and vetoed the bill, but Congress mustered the two-thirds vote necessary to overturn the veto, and it became law.[62]"", ""The elections of 1878 returned control of both houses of Congress to the Democrats for the first time since before the Civil War.  The new Democratic majority passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts.[63] Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race and allowed the use of federal troops to supervise elections.  Bayard supported the effort, which passed both houses and sent to the President.[64]  Hayes was determined to preserve the law to protect black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation.[63]  Bayard spoke in favor of the bill, believing the time had come to end the military's involvement in Southern politics.[64]  The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider.  Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more.[63]  Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Force Acts.[63] The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were cut off.[63]"", ""Bayard also clashed with Hayes on the issue of Chinese immigration.  In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. Bayard criticized the treaty because it treated Americans and the Chinese as equal races, when he believed the latter was inferior.[65] As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages.[66] During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots broke out in San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed with an emphasis on stopping Chinese immigration.[66]  Bayard favored some restriction on Chinese immigration and voted in favor of a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, which passed both houses that year.[67] Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the United States should not abrogate treaties without negotiation.[68] The veto drew praise among some New England Republicans, but was bitterly denounced in the West.[68]  After the veto, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration.[69] Congress passed a new law to that effect, the Chinese Exclusion Act, in 1882.[69]  Bayard supported this new act, which became law with President Chester A. Arthur's signature that year.[70]"", 'By the time the Democrats had assembled in Chicago on July 8, 1884 to begin their convention, the Republicans had already picked their nominee: James G. Blaine of Maine.  Blaine\'s nomination turned many reform-minded Republicans (known as Mugwumps) away from their party.  Bayard and Cleveland, seen as honest politicians, were the Democrats most favored by the renegade Republican faction.[99]  Bayard was optimistic at the start of the convention, but the results of the first ballot ran heavily against him: 170 votes to Cleveland\'s 392.[100]  The reason was the same as in 1880: as Representative Robert S. Stevens of New York said, ""I believe if he were President his Administration would be one in which every American citizen would take pride. I believe he is a patriot, but it would be a suicidal attempt to nominate him. His [1861] Dover speech would be sent into every household in the North.""[101]  The voting the next day demonstrated the point, as Cleveland was nominated on the second ballot.[100]', ""Bayard remained in London until the arrival of his successor, John Hay, in April 1897.[148] That same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.[149] He returned to Wilmington that May and visited ex-President Cleveland at his home in Princeton the following month, remaining friendly with him despite their differences on the Venezuela question.[148]  Bayard's health had begun to decline in England, and he was often ill after his return to the United States.  He died on September 28, 1898, while visiting his daughter Mabel Bayard Warren in Dedham, Massachusetts.[150]  Bayard was buried in the Old Swedes Episcopal Church Cemetery at Wilmington.  He was survived by his second wife and seven of his twelve children, including Thomas F. Bayard Jr., who would serve in the United States Senate from 1922 to 1929.[151]""]"

He became a member of the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly for Godfrey Huggins's ruling United Party in 1939. Appointed Huggins's Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1940, he retained that role until 1946, when he became Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice; the Education and Health portfolios were added two years later. He retired from politics in 1950 to become a Judge of the High Court of Southern Rhodesia. In 1961, he was knighted and appointed Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia; three years later he became president of the High Court's new Appellate Division and a member of the British Privy Council."", ""Beadle's de jure recognition of the post-UDI government in Rhodesia in 1968 outraged the Wilson government and drew accusations from the British Prime Minister and others that he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; he was almost removed from the Imperial Privy Council, but kept his place following Wilson's 1970 electoral defeat soon after. Beadle retired in April 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences."", 'After returning to Rhodesia, Beadle took an interest in politics; he joined the United Party, created from the former Rhodesia Party and the conservative faction of the Reform Party to contest the 1934 general election. He was attracted to the United Party not so much by its policies but by his admiration for its leading figures—he considered the Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins ""a man of the calibre I think of Rhodes"".[8] The Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial Legislative Assembly were overwhelmingly from the white minority (about 5% of the population).[9][10] The United Party broadly represented commercial interests, civil servants and the professional classes.[8]', 'Beadle filled the seat on the High Court bench vacated by Sir Robert Tredgold, who had just been appointed Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia.[20] Despite his close relationship with Huggins, Beadle had strong misgivings regarding Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland,[8] which became Huggins\'s flagship project.[n 1] Beadle argued that since the British government would never devolve indigenous African affairs to Federal responsibility, native policy in the three territories would never be co-ordinated, meaning ""the thing was bound to crash"".[8] Nevertheless, Huggins sent him to London in 1949 to discuss the legal problems of the proposed Federation with the British government.[22] Beadle later expressed regrets that he had not played a bigger role in drawing up the constitution for the Federation,[8] which was inaugurated as an indissoluble entity in 1953, following a mostly white referendum in Southern Rhodesia.[23] Huggins spent three years as Federal Prime Minister before retiring in 1956.[24] Whitehead became Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia in 1958.[25]', 'After Leonie\'s death in 1953, Beadle married Olive Jackson, of Salisbury, in 1954.[2] He later said that he was repeatedly asked to resign from the bench to become the Federal Minister of Law or stand for Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, but ""didn\'t regard any of the issues as crucial enough to warrant my going back"".[26] Beadle\'s biographer Claire Palley describes him as ""a learned, fair but also adventurous judge"".[2] He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1957 New Year Honours.[27] In August 1959, amid rising black nationalism and opposition to the Federation, particularly in the two northern territories, Beadle chaired a three-man tribunal on the Southern Rhodesian government\'s preventive detention of black nationalist leaders without trial during the disturbances. He upheld the government\'s actions, reporting that the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress had disseminated ""subversive propaganda"", encouraged racial hatred, intimidated people into joining and undermined the authority of tribal chiefs, government officials and police.[28]', 'Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, renamed Zambia and Malawi respectively, under black majority governments in 1964. As independence talks between the British and Southern Rhodesian governments continued with little progress, speculation began to mount that the colonial government might attempt a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) if no accommodation could be found. The British High Commissioner in Salisbury, J\xa0B Johnston, had few doubts about how Beadle would respond to such an act, writing that he was ""quite certain that no personal considerations would deflect him for a moment from administering the law with absolute integrity.""[37] Arthur Bottomley, the British Сommonwealth Secretary, took a similar line, describing Beadle to the Prime Minister Harold Wilson as ""a staunch constitutionalist"" who would be disposed to ""frustrate any illegal action by Mr Smith\'s government"".[37]', ""Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House to inform him personally and ask him to resign. Gibbs made clear that he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal.[41] When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so.[42]"", 'Beadle\'s acceptance of the post-UDI order effectively placed him on the side of the RF and removed any chance of his regaining an intermediary role with Wilson. The British Prime Minister minimised the political impact of the Chief Justice\'s decision by presenting it as evidence that Beadle had furtively supported UDI all along, and subsequently excluded him from the diplomatic dialogue. Wilson pursued a second initiative which led to a fresh round of talks with Smith off Gibraltar aboard HMS Fearless in October 1968.[62] Marked progress towards agreement was made but the Rhodesian delegation demurred on a new British proposal, the ""double safeguard"". This would involve elected black Rhodesians controlling a blocking quarter in the Rhodesian parliament, with the power to veto retrogressive legislation, and thereafter having the right to appeal passed bills to the Privy Council in London. Smith\'s team accepted the principle of the blocking quarter but agreement could not be reached on the technicalities;[63] the involvement of the Privy Council was rejected by Smith as a ""ridiculous"" provision that would prejudice Rhodesia\'s sovereignty. The talks ended without success.[64]', '""A short, stocky man of ruddy complexion with a toothbrush moustache,"" Claire Palley writes, ""Beadle had a blunt manner, looking hard at all whom he encountered. His drive and enthusiasm were overwhelming, whether at work, in charitable activities, or as a courageous hunter and fisherman. He had a warm family life and many friends.""[2] According to J.R.T. Wood, Wilson ""hated Beadle perhaps because Beadle was clever but spoke his mind"";[75] the British Prime Minister described Beadle to Lord Alport shortly after UDI as combining ""the courage of a lion"" with ""the smartness of a fox"".[44] In Lord Blake\'s History of Rhodesia, Beadle is characterised as ""an irrepressible, bouncy extrovert, who does not always perceive the reaction which he causes in others.""[76] Garfield Todd, Premier of Southern Rhodesia from 1956 to 1958, saw Beadle as ""impulsive"" and ""always inclined to overstate his case"".[77]']"

Ipswich (and later England) manager Bobby Robson called him the best England player he had seen."", 'Thomas Kevin Beattie was born in Carlisle on 18 December 1953.[3] His family lived in the Botcherby estate and he was one of nine children: five boys and four girls.[4] He became known by his middle name, as his father was also named Thomas Beattie.[5] Beattie\'s mother was a cleaner at a Lipton tea shop, whilst his father worked for the National Coal Board, delivering coal.[5] The elder Thomas played amateur football as a goalkeeper and once had a trial with Aston Villa, but turned down an offer to join the club as he could earn more working for the Coal Board.[6] After he was forced to give up work due to a back problem,[7] the family suffered financially and were often short of food,[8] leading to the young Beattie taking fruit and vegetables from local allotments.[7] In later life, he recalled, ""There was often only food on the table when Dad had backed a winning horse, or else won a game of darts, or dominoes down at his local pub.""[8][9]', 'Beattie supported his local football team, Carlisle United, and idolised players like Hughie McIlmoyle. He recalled being ""devastated"" when McIlmoyle was too busy to sign an autograph outside the club, resolving never to turn down such requests.[10] Beattie attended St Cuthbert\'s Roman Catholic junior school, where he began playing football for the school team, initially as a goalkeeper.[6] His family were unable to afford the football boots he needed, but a teacher named Mr Raffety bought a pair for him.[6] Beattie soon became a forward and modelled himself on Chelsea\'s Peter Osgood.[11]', ""Although Beattie passed his eleven-plus exams, his family could not afford the grammar school uniform, so he moved to St Patrick's Roman Catholic senior school.[11] He began playing for Blackfriars, a local youth team managed by Raffety, and also, from the age of 14, for a pub team, alongside his father.[11] Raffety recommended him to Carlisle United, but the club did not have a youth team.[11] Beattie was also told that Celtic had shown an interest in him, but the club had been wrongly told that he was not a Catholic, the traditional religion of the majority of the club's fanbase.[10][12] He left school aged 14, and subsequently worked as a machine fitter and delivery boy in factories, a warehouse, a dry cleaner and then a furniture company.[13]"", 'At the age of 15, Beattie was playing for Blackfriars on Sunday and for a club called St Augustine on Saturdays, when he was spotted by a football scout and offered a trial with Liverpool.[13] Beattie travelled to Liverpool and impressed manager Bill Shankly sufficiently for him to be invited back to sign for the club. Beattie returned to Liverpool on his own, but nobody from the club arrived to meet him at Lime Street station. After waiting an hour and assuming they had lost interest, and with nothing but his boots and train ticket, he returned home to Carlisle.[14] Shankly would later describe missing out on signing the youngster as one of his biggest mistakes.[2]', 'Soon after this, Beattie joined Ipswich Town as an apprentice. Ipswich manager Bobby Robson made sure that he was met at Euston station in London, played in a youth match at Fulham, and was accompanied all the way to Ipswich\'s Portman Road ground by the club\'s chief scout, Ron Gray.[15] Robson told Gray, ""If you miss him, you\'ve lost your job"".[16] The poverty Beattie came from was evident when he arrived in Ipswich wearing his father\'s shoes, so when Ipswich signed him, the club immediately bought him some clothes.[3][16] As a youth he had played as a striker, but Robson converted him into a defender, usually a centre-half; the player said in later life that the move suited him well, as it meant he could see all the play in front of him.[16]', 'Now earning a wage, Beattie tried to help support his family, sending money home each week.[17] He also stepped in to prevent domestic violence between his parents: ""I became extremely upset when I found out that Dad was spending the money that I had been sending home on drink and Mum was going without. Not only that but I also found out that his drinking had got worse and he had started knocking Mum around.""[17]', ""Beattie was given his first-team debut aged 18 against Manchester United in the opening match of the 1972–73 season in England's top division.[18][19] Ipswich won the game 2–1, and afterwards he asked United's Bobby Charlton for his autograph; Charlton told Beattie that his play reminded him of Duncan Edwards and that, in years to come, he would be the one signing autographs.[16] Beattie scored his first league goal for the club two weeks later at Elland Road in a 3–3 draw with Leeds United.[20] That season he featured 38 times for Ipswich in the league and scored 5 goals;[20] Ipswich ended in fourth place, their best finish since the Championship-winning 1961–62 season under Alf Ramsey.[21] Beattie was also part of the 1972–73 Texaco Cup-winning team, which defeated Norwich City 4–2 on aggregate over two legs,[21] and he was named the inaugural winner of the Ipswich Town Player of the Year award.[22]"", 'The following season saw Beattie\'s first appearance in a European competition, with Ipswich having qualified for the UEFA Cup as a result of their fourth position in the league the previous season.[21] He played in aggregate victories over Real Madrid (1–0), Lazio (6–4) and FC Twente (3–1), before the side lost on penalties to Lokomotive Leipzig, Beattie having scored his first European goal in the home leg.[23][24] He appeared in all 42 league games for Ipswich that season (along with Mick Mills), made 15 other appearances in cup competitions,[25] and was presented with the inaugural Professional Footballers\' Association\'s (PFA) Young Player of the Year award.[26] He was also once again voted his club\'s Player of the Year.[22] Early in the 1974–75 season Beattie was involved in mild controversy against Stoke City when his tackle at Portman Road broke John Ritchie\'s leg. In the return fixture at Stoke\'s Victoria Ground, Beattie\'s teammate Allan Hunter was involved in an incident that left Stoke\'s Denis Smith with a broken leg.[27] The crowd erupted in anger, directed at Beattie; Robson noted ""There was a cauldron for 20 minutes. Kevin Beattie had to beat 28,000 people out there.""[28] Later that season, Beattie was awarded the captaincy for a game, against his home team Carlisle United.[29] Having played 52 games and scored 6 goals during the season for Ipswich,[25] he was elected by his peers as a member of the First Division Team of the Year.[30] He had helped his club reach the semi-final of the 1974–75 FA Cup and to finish the league season in third position.[31]', ""Beattie made 36 appearances for Ipswich during the 1975–76 season, scoring 4 goals.[25] Ipswich finished sixth and were knocked out of the 1975–76 FA Cup in the fourth round.[32] Towards the end of the season, he began to suffer from severe back pain, something he blamed on an injury incurred as a child while helping his father carry sacks of coal.[33] Despite the relative lack of success with his club, he was selected in the First Division Team of the Year for the second year in a row.[34] The 1976–77 season started well for Ipswich with victories over Liverpool and Manchester United. Ipswich then achieved a club record-equalling 7–0 win over West Bromwich Albion: the Albion goalkeeper John Osborne said of Beattie's long-range goal that he regarded himself as fortunate he had not touched it as it would have knocked his hand off.[35] Beattie's season was prematurely curtailed by a self-inflicted injury:[36] stoking a bonfire at his home, he decided to add petrol; the ensuing flare-up gave him serious burns to his face and neck,[37] leading to him missing six matches.[16] Before the injury, Ipswich were challenging for the league title, but, in Beattie's absence, the side lost four of their last six matches and missed out on winning the championship by five points.[16] He played in 34 games for Ipswich that season, scoring 5 goals, and was selected for the PFA Team of the Year for the third time in a row, along with teammates Mick Mills and Brian Talbot.[34]"", 'Beattie was fit to play by the start of the 1977–78 season,[38] but a knee injury sustained in a league match led to him withdrawing from the England squad to face Luxembourg. Further investigation revealed he had damaged cartilage in his knee, which required an operation.[39] Having had three weeks\' recuperation and a cortisone injection, he was restored to the Ipswich squad in time to play in the third round UEFA Cup home leg against FC Barcelona. Ipswich won the fixture 3–0,[40] and even though he suffered a reaction in his knee, he insisted he was able to play in the away leg. Robson disagreed, and Beattie was left out of the side for the game; Ipswich were knocked out on penalties.[41] Cortisone injections became commonplace for Beattie, who returned to the team in time for the FA Cup fourth-round victory against Hartlepool.[42] Although Ipswich\'s form in the league was poor, they were safe from relegation by the time they faced West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup semi-final at Highbury, a game for which Beattie was given the all-clear.[42] A 3–1 victory saw Ipswich into the final, yet the next day his knee was once again swollen and his participation in the final was in jeopardy.[43] According to Beattie, ""the boss secretly told me that if I felt fit enough to play then I was in"".[44] Robson did not announce the Cup final team until the last minute: it included a formation change to include five midfielders and Paul Mariner as a lone striker – and Beattie in defence.[45] Roger Osborne\'s late goal for Ipswich was the only score of the game, and they won the trophy.[46] Beattie had three cortisone injections to get through the final.[47] Following the cup final success, he and teammates Robin Turner and David Geddis were awarded the freedom of Carlisle.[48] Beattie had represented Ipswich 21 times during the course of the season, without scoring a goal.[25]', 'Shortly into the 1978–79 season, Beattie suffered problems with his other knee. Two further operations followed, and he was confined to treatment and physiotherapy,[49] only, in his words, ""wheeled out for the really big games"".[50] Overall, he made 26 appearances that season, scoring twice.[25] The 1979–80 season saw him make just 12 appearances, twice as substitute, and score twice, as his post-match recuperation took weeks, not days.[25][51] He also played a ""bit-part"" in the 1980–81 season, usually as a striker instead of his usual position of centre-half. However, his defensive role in the two-leg victory over the Czechoslovakian team Bohemians, in the second round of the 1980–81 UEFA Cup, for which he was awarded man of the match, proved vital to Ipswich\'s season.[52] Although irregularly selected as a result of his injuries, Beattie played in the fourth round, first leg 4–1 away victory over AS Saint-Étienne, whose team included Michel Platini and Johnny Rep.[53] Ipswich won the home leg 3–1 without Beattie.[54] He played his last match for Ipswich in April 1981, in an FA Cup semi-final loss to Manchester City in which he broke his arm.[55] Ipswich won the UEFA Cup at the end of the season, but Beattie  was not presented with a winner\'s medal as he did not play in the final or even appear on the bench, through injury; 26 years later, a petition was organised by Rob Finch, the writer of Beattie\'s 2007 biography The Greatest Footballer England Never Had, calling on UEFA to right the wrong.[56] Beattie was finally awarded a medal by UEFA president Michel Platini at the 2008 UEFA Cup Final between Rangers and Zenit Saint Petersburg.[57]', 'Beattie retired due to injury in December 1981,[58] following five knee operations in four years.[26] His testimonial game took place in March 1982, against a Dynamo Moscow XI.[59][60]', 'Beattie retired due to injury in December 1981,[58] following five knee operations in four years.[26] His testimonial game took place in March 1982, against a Dynamo Moscow XI.[59][60]', 'In the off-season of 1982, Beattie began training with Norwich City under manager Ken Brown who offered him a short-term contract.[61] The offer was soon withdrawn because Ipswich were reluctant to release Beattie to their local rivals.[61] Instead, he joined another East Anglian team, Colchester United, whose player-manager was Allan Hunter, a former team-mate of Beattie.[61] Beattie made six appearances for the club,[62] four of those in the league,[63] but when teammate John Lyons committed suicide, Hunter resigned,[64] and Beattie decided to move on. He signed for Middlesbrough, where he made five appearances during that season, scoring once, a penalty, in a 2–0 FA Cup victory over Notts County.[65] His time at the club ended when he suffered a serious groin injury whilst playing against north-east rivals Newcastle United.[66]', 'In the off-season of 1982, Beattie began training with Norwich City under manager Ken Brown who offered him a short-term contract.[61] The offer was soon withdrawn because Ipswich were reluctant to release Beattie to their local rivals.[61] Instead, he joined another East Anglian team, Colchester United, whose player-manager was Allan Hunter, a former team-mate of Beattie.[61] Beattie made six appearances for the club,[62] four of those in the league,[63] but when teammate John Lyons committed suicide, Hunter resigned,[64] and Beattie decided to move on.

He moved to Norway, signing for fourth division club Kongsberg IF, where he scored more than 60 goals in his first season.[71] He signed for Norwegian second division club Nybergsund IL-Trysil in 1988, making five appearances for them before moving back to England.[72][73] He also played for Clacton Town.[18][74] He assisted Mike Walker and Duncan Forbes at Norwich City as a scout during Walker\'s time as manager and performed a similar role for Alan Ball Jr. at Portsmouth.[75] Beattie\'s first foray into coaching was a part-time position at his hometown club Carlisle United under Roddy Collins in the 2002–03 season.[76][77] Collins was sacked early in the 2003–04 season,[78] and Beattie left the club, subsequently opting to coach school children in the United States.[79] His last coaching position was a short spell with Barry Fry at Peterborough United.[79]', 'Dropping into non-League football, Beattie signed for Barry Fry\'s Barnet, joining another ex-England international, Steve Whitworth.[67] Injury and, according to Beattie, ""a combination of the drink and depression"" curtailed his spell at the club.[68] After failing to secure any coaching work, Beattie took up work as a labourer, and joined local team Harwich & Parkeston to supplement his income.[69] Accepting an offer from Ipswich\'s former scout Ron Gray, Beattie joined Swedish second-tier side Sandvikens IF under manager and former Swedish international player, Thomas Nordahl.[70] Soon afterward, Nordahl suddenly resigned and the club let Beattie go.

When Beattie arrived at Colchester, ""into his thirties"" and with his knees ""all shot"", ""he was still the quickest player at the club over ten yards by a long way.""[16] Groves recalls Robson\'s summary of Beattie\'s strengths as a player:', ""What a player the boy was\xa0... He could climb higher than the crossbar and still head the ball down. He had the sweetest left foot I've ever seen and could hit 60-yard passes, without looking, that eliminated six opposition players from the game. He had the strength of a tank, was lightning quick and he could tackle.[16]"", ""During his years with Ipswich, Beattie formed a central defensive partnership with Allan Hunter. Robson described them as 'Bacon and eggs'.[85] Interviewed in 2018, Hunter talked about their partnership:"", 'we just gelled and if I went and done things to attack the ball he was always behind me – and vice-versa. We didn\'t need to work at it because it was something that came naturally\xa0... We were just a good partnership\xa0... me and Beat would be sitting on the other side of a room from each other and we would know what the other was thinking because there were times I would, or he would, burst out laughing and the boys would say, what you bloody laughing at? And we would say ""mind your own business""\xa0... It helped on the field because we didn\'t even have to talk because we knew each other\'s play.[85]', 'In December 1974, Beattie was involved in an incident that prompted newspaper headlines across the quality and tabloid press.[86] Called up to represent England at under-23 level against Scotland under-23s at Pittodrie,[87] Beattie was ""put on the right train by his manager Bobby Robson"", yet failed to arrive in Manchester.[86] That Beattie was ""found"" playing dominoes with his father in a pub in Carlisle helped substantiate the story, although England manager Don Revie sent Beattie a telegram wishing him a happy birthday, the following day.[86] Groves\' account, 30 years later, is that when Beattie\'s train pulled into Carlisle station, he saw the name, felt homesick and went to visit his father.[16] Media coverage at the time ascribed Beattie\'s lapses to pressure; factors cited included his then four-week-old daughter, his rags-to-riches climb and a virus.[86] Subsequent reports that he then missed training for Ipswich, allegedly preferring to stay in bed when passed fit by the club doctor, fuelled the story further.[86] Ipswich suspended him for one match.[86]', 'Beattie accepted a lit cigarette from a fan and smoked it whilst collecting his FA Cup winner\'s medal in 1978.[16] According to Groves, Beattie smoked 20 cigarettes a day for the duration of his playing career; he also missed part of pre-season for Colchester because he ""strained too much"" while defecating, resulting in a pulled stomach muscle.[16]', 'Beattie was unemployed on several occasions after finishing his playing career. Groves writes about how the unemployment office where Beattie would sign on was so close to Ipswich\'s home ground that he would see players arriving in their ""flash motors"", while he signed autographs.[16] After running a pub,[2] he began drinking very heavily and was on one occasion given the last rites when his pancreas ""packed up"".[16][88] He considered suicide,[88] but was able to care for his wife who was seriously unwell, and, according to Groves, managed to get ""his life back on the right track"".[16] Nonetheless, Beattie became impoverished, and despite receiving £50,000 from a testimonial match organised by Ipswich Town, he depended on financial help from the PFA.[3] In later years, Beattie worked for broadcast media;[26] he commented on football for BBC Radio Suffolk until the day before his death.[89] He also co-wrote his autobiography, The Beat, published in 1998.[90] In May 2012, Beattie was convicted of benefit fraud and given a 12-week curfew.[91] He had failed to disclose his earnings from radio, for fear of losing Income Support.[3] He later apologised and described it as a ""silly mistake"".[92]', 'Beattie met his future wife Margaret Boldy, known as Maggie, in the late 1960s or early 1970s in a youth club near to his apprentice accommodation, Beattie describing it as ""love at first sight"".[93] They married in 1974, and soon afterward she appeared in Radio Times in a ""Footballers\' Wives"" feature; at that point the couple were still living in a ""modest"" club-owned house.[94] Maggie was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis during the mid-1980s; she was later confined to a wheelchair,[95] with Beattie as her carer in their council-owned bungalow.[90] They had three daughters, Emma, Sarah and Louise.[95]', 'His playing career injuries gave Beattie difficulties in later life: by the time he was 53 he was ""unable to walk more than half a mile"", owing to the arthritis in his knees.[2] He refused to bow to his difficulties: ""Maggie, bless her, never complains"", he said to a Daily Telegraph reporter, ""so why should I feel any anger at how life turned out?"".[2] On 16 September 2018, Beattie died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 64.[89] He was survived by his wife and daughters.[3] His funeral was held at the crematorium at Nacton on 26 October 2018.[96] Former Ipswich and England player Terry Butcher paid tribute to Beattie, calling him ""the complete footballer"" and describing his left-footed shot as an ""Exocet"".[90] George Burley referred to Beattie as ""a legend"", while John Wark, whose nickname for Beattie was ""Monster"", described him as the best-ever Ipswich player.[90]', 'Beattie was once described by Bobby Robson as the best England player he had seen,[91] and that he could have rivalled Duncan Edwards.[84] Beattie was inducted into the Ipswich Town Hall of Fame in 2008,[97] was voted numerous times as Ipswich Town\'s ""best ever player"",[55] and features as one of Perry Groves\' 20 ""Football Heroes"" in a book published in 2009.[16]', 'Along with some of his Ipswich teammates,[98] Beattie featured in the 1981 film Escape to Victory. His skills were shown on the pitch as the body double for Michael Caine\'s prisoner-of-war character, and the two became friends.[84] Beattie had a cooler relationship with Sylvester Stallone, who also starred in the film: ""There weren\'t too many that got on that well with him and after I beat him in an arm wrestle\xa0– first my right arm and then my left – he didn\'t speak to me again"".[84] A campaign for a permanent memorial to Beattie to be placed outside Portman Road, along with the existing statues of Robson and Ramsey, was started soon after his death by Ipswich Star and East Anglian Daily Times editor Brad Jones.[99] The design for the statue was revealed on 19 March 2019 by local sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn.[100] It was confirmed in August 2019 that the funds required to build the statue had been raised.[101] On 18 December 2021, on what would have been Beattie\'s 68th birthday, his statue was officially unveiled outside Portman Road.[102]', 'Ipswich Town', 'Individual']"

He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor. He could also use his influence as governor to sway the party's choice of his potential successor as governor.

He became a wealthy planter and slaveowner and was elected to and served in both houses of the Louisiana legislature prior to his election by the legislature to the US Senate in 1852.[1] There, he was a vocal supporter of slavery. After Louisiana seceded in 1861, Benjamin resigned as senator and returned to New Orleans. He soon moved to Richmond after Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him as Attorney General.  Benjamin had little to do in that position, but Davis was impressed by his competence and appointed him as Secretary of War.  Benjamin firmly supported Davis, and the President reciprocated the loyalty by promoting him to Secretary of State in March 1862, while Benjamin was being criticized for the rebel defeat at the Battle of Roanoke Island.', 'At the age of 14, in 1825, Benjamin entered Yale College, an institution popular among white Southerners; Vice President John C. Calhoun, a South Carolinian, was among its alumni. Although Benjamin was successful as a student at Yale, he left abruptly in 1827 without completing his course of study. The reasons for this are uncertain: In 1861, when Louisiana left the Union and Benjamin resigned as a U.S. senator, an abolitionist newspaper alleged that he had been caught as a thief at Yale.  He considered bringing suit for libel but litigation was impractical. In 1901, his sole surviving classmate wrote that Benjamin had been expelled for gambling. One of his biographers, Robert Meade, considered the evidence of wrongdoing by Benjamin to be ""too strong to be ignored"", but noted that at the time Benjamin left Yale, he was only 16 years old.[8]', 'Benjamin scaled back his involvement in politics in the late 1840s, distracted by his plantation and law practice.[25] His mother Rebecca, whom he had brought to New Orleans, died in 1847 during a yellow fever epidemic.[26] In 1848, Benjamin was a Whig member of the Electoral College; he voted for fellow Louisiana planter, General Zachary Taylor, who was elected U.S. President.[27] He and other Louisianans accompanied President-elect Taylor to Washington for his inauguration, and Benjamin attended a state dinner given by outgoing president James K. Polk.[28]  In 1850, Millard Fillmore, who succeeded Taylor after his death earlier that year, appointed Benjamin as judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  He was confirmed by the Senate, but he declined the appointment as the salary of $3,500 was too small.[29] The following year, Benjamin assisted the United States Attorney in New Orleans in prosecuting American adventurers who had tried to spark a rebellion against Spanish rule in Cuba, but two trials both ended in hung juries.[27]', 'The outgoing president, Fillmore, offered to nominate Benjamin, a fellow Whig, to fill a Supreme Court vacancy after the Senate Democrats had defeated Fillmore\'s other nominees for the post. The New York Times reported on February 15, 1853, that ""if the President nominates Benjamin, the Democrats are determined to confirm him.""[33] The new president, Franklin Pierce, a Democrat, also offered Benjamin a place on the Supreme Court. Pierce Butler suggested in his 1908 biography of Benjamin that the newly elected senator likely declined these offers not only because he preferred active politics, but because he could maintain his law practice and substantial income as a senator, but could not as a justice.[34] As an advocate before the U.S. Supreme Court, Benjamin won 13 of his first 18 cases.[35]', ""Judah Benjamin was sworn in as senator from Louisiana on March 4, 1853, at a brief meeting called just prior to President Pierce's inauguration. These new colleagues included Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia, and Sam Houston of Texas. The slavery issue was in a brief remission as much of the country wished to accept the Compromise of 1850 as a final settlement. When the Senate was not in session, Benjamin remained in Washington, D.C., conducting a lucrative practice including many cases before the Supreme Court, then conveniently located in a room of the Capitol. His law partners in New Orleans took care of his firm's affairs there. About this time Benjamin sold his interest in Bellechasse, lacking the time to deal with plantation business.[36]"", ""Benjamin worked to deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, feeling he had turned against the South. Douglas contended that although the Supreme Court, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, had stated Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was anathema to the South. Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former US Representative Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas Benjamin considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention was not able to nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted for a bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent from Key West. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.[51][52]"", ""Fearful of arrest as a rebel once he left the Senate, Benjamin quickly departed Washington for New Orleans. On the day of Benjamin's resignation, the Provisional Confederate States Congress gathered in Montgomery, Alabama, and soon chose Davis as president. Davis was sworn in as provisional Confederate States President on February 18, 1861. At home in New Orleans for, it would prove, the last time, Benjamin addressed a rally on Washington's Birthday, February 22, 1861.[63] On February 25, Davis appointed Benjamin, still in New Orleans, as attorney general; the Louisianan was approved immediately and unanimously by the provisional Congress.[64] Davis thus became the first chief executive in North America to appoint a Jew to his Cabinet.[65]"", 'As War Secretary, Benjamin was responsible for a territory stretching from Virginia to Texas.  It was his job, with Davis looking over his shoulder, to supervise the Confederate Army and to feed, supply, and arm it in a nascent country with almost no arms manufacturers.  Accordingly, Benjamin saw his job as closely tied to foreign affairs, as the Confederacy was dependent on imports to supply its troops. Davis had chosen a ""defensive war"" strategy: the Confederacy would await invasion by the Union and then seek to defeat its armies until Lincoln tired of sending them. Davis and Benjamin worked together closely, and as Davis came to realize that his subordinate was loyal to the Confederacy and to Davis personally, he returned complete trust in Benjamin. Varina Davis wrote, ""It was to me a curious spectacle, the steady approximation to a thorough friendliness of the President and his War Minister.  It was a very gradual rapprochement, but all the more solid for that reason.""[75]', 'The Confederate States Congress established a special committee to investigate the military losses, and Benjamin testified before it.[90] The Secretary of State, Virginia\'s Robert M. T. Hunter, had quarreled with Davis and resigned, and in March 1862, Benjamin was appointed as his replacement. Varina Davis noted that some in Congress had sought Benjamin\'s ouster ""because of reverses which no one could have averted, [so] the President promoted him to the State Department with a personal and aggrieved sense of injustice done to the man who had now become his friend and right hand.""[91] Richmond diarist Sallie Ann Brock Putnam wrote, ""Mr. Benjamin was not forgiven... this act on the part of the President [in promoting Benjamin], in defiance of public opinion, was considered as unwise, arbitrary, and a reckless risking of his reputation and popularity... [Benjamin] was ever afterwards unpopular in the Confederacy, and particularly in Virginia.""[92] Despite the promotion, the committee reported that any blame for the defeat at Roanoke Island should attach to Wise\'s superior, Major General Benjamin Huger, ""and the late secretary of war, J.P. Benjamin.""[93]', 'Meade wrote that, since the Secretary of State would have to work closely with Jefferson Davis, Benjamin was likely the person best suited to the position.[103] In addition to his relationship with the President, Benjamin was very close to the Confederate First Lady, Varina Davis, with whom he exchanged confidences regarding war events and the President\'s health. ""Together, and by turns, they could help him over the most difficult days.""[104]', 'In January 1865, Lincoln, who had been re-elected the previous November, sent Francis Blair as an emissary to Richmond, hoping to secure reunion without further bloodshed.  Both sides agreed to a meeting at Fort Monroe, Virginia.  Benjamin drafted vague instructions for the Southern delegation, led by Vice President Alexander Stephens, but Davis insisted on modifying them to refer to North and South as ""two nations"".  This was the point that scuttled the Hampton Roads Conference; Lincoln would not consider the South a separate entity, insisting on union and emancipation.[136]', 'By March 1865, the Confederate military situation was desperate.  Most major population centers had fallen, and General Lee\'s defense of Richmond was faltering against massive Union forces.  Nevertheless, Benjamin retained his usual good humor; on the evening of April 1, with evacuation likely, he was at the State Department offices, singing a silly ballad of his own composition, ""The Exit from Shocko Hill"", a graveyard district located in Richmond.[137] On April 2, Lee sent word that he could only keep Union troops away from the line of the Richmond and Danville Railroad—the only railroad still running out of Richmond—for a short time. Those who did not leave Richmond would be trapped.[138] At 11:00 pm that night, the Confederate President and Cabinet left aboard a Danville-bound train. Navy Secretary Stephen R. Mallory recorded that Benjamin\'s ""hope and good humor [was] inexhaustible\xa0... with a \'never-give-up-the-ship\' sort of air, referred to other great national causes which had been redeemed from far gloomier reverses than ours"".[139]']"

Garfield and Chester A. Arthur, and then from 1889 to 1892 under President Benjamin Harrison. He is one of only two U.S. Secretaries of State to hold the position under three separate presidents, the other being Daniel Webster. Blaine unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for President in 1876 and 1880 before being nominated in 1884. In the 1884 general election, he was narrowly defeated by Democratic nominee Grover Cleveland. Blaine was one of the late 19th century\'s leading Republicans and a champion of the party\'s moderate reformist faction, later known as the ""Half-Breeds"".', 'Blaine was reelected in 1864 and, when the 39th Congress assembled in December 1865, the main issue was the Reconstruction of the defeated Confederate States.[33] Although he was not a member of the committee charged with drafting what became the Fourteenth Amendment, Blaine did make his views on the subject known and believed that three-fourths of the non-seceded states would be needed to ratify it, rather than three-fourths of all states, an opinion that did not prevail and placed him, atypically, in the radical camp.[34] The Republican Congress also played a role in the governance of the conquered South, dissolving the state governments President Andrew Johnson had installed and substituting military governments under Congress\' control.[35] Blaine voted in favor of these new, harsher measures, but also supported some leniency toward the former rebels when he opposed a bill that would have barred Southerners from attending the United States Military Academy.[35] Blaine voted to impeach Johnson in 1868, although he had initially opposed the effort.[36] Later, Blaine was more ambiguous about the validity of the charges against Johnson, writing that ""there was a very grave difference of opinion among those equally competent to decide,""[37] but he followed his party\'s leaders.[38]', 'Blaine was an effective Speaker with a magnetic personality. In the words of Washington journalist Benjamin Perley Poore, Blaine\'s ""graceful as well as powerful figure, his strong features, glowing with health, and his hearty, honest manner, made him an attractive speaker and an esteemed friend.""[46] Moreover, President Ulysses S. Grant valued his skill and loyalty in leading the House.[47] He enjoyed the job and made his presence in Washington more permanent by buying a large residence on Fifteenth Street in the city.[48] At the same time, the Blaine family moved to a mansion in Augusta.[48][a]', ""During Blaine's six-year tenure as Speaker his popularity continued to grow, and Republicans dissatisfied with Grant mentioned Blaine as a potential presidential candidate prior to the 1872 Republican National Convention.[49] Instead, Blaine worked steadfastly for Grant's re-election.[49] Blaine's growing fame brought growing opposition from the Democrats, as well, and during the 1872 campaign he was accused of receiving bribes in the Crédit Mobilier scandal.[50] Blaine denied any part in the scandal, which involved railroad companies bribing federal officials to turn a blind eye to fraudulent railroad contracts that overcharged the government by millions of dollars.[50] No one was able to satisfactorily prove Blaine's involvement. Though not an absolute defense, it is true that the law that made the fraud possible had been written before he was elected to Congress. But other Republicans were exposed by the accusations, including Vice President Colfax, who was dropped from the 1872 presidential ticket in favor of Henry Wilson.[50]"", ""Once out of the speaker's chair, Blaine had more time to concentrate on his presidential ambitions, and to develop new policy ideas.[55] One result was a foray into education policy. In late 1875, President Grant made several speeches on the importance of the separation of church and state and the duty of the states to provide free public education.[56] Blaine saw in this an issue that would distract from the Grant administration scandals and let the Republican party regain the high moral ground.[55] In December 1875, he proposed a joint resolution that became known as the Blaine Amendment.[55]"", ""Blaine received the news at his home in Washington and telegraphed Hayes his congratulations.[71] In the subsequent contest of 1876, Hayes was elected after a contentious compromise over disputed electoral votes.[72] The results of the convention had further effects on Blaine's political career because Bristow, having lost the nomination, resigned as Treasury Secretary three days after the convention ended.[71] President Grant selected Senator Lot M. Morrill of Maine to fill the cabinet post, and Maine's governor, Seldon Connor, appointed Blaine to the now-vacant Senate seat.[71] When the Maine Legislature reconvened that autumn, it confirmed Blaine's appointment and elected him to the full six-year term that would begin on March 4, 1877.[71][d]"", ""On monetary issues, Blaine continued the advocacy for a strong dollar that he had begun as a Representative.[78] This stance was in opposition to Senate Republican leadership, including Senate President Pro Tempore Thomas W. Ferry, who generally supported the greenback movement.[79] The issue had shifted from debate over greenbacks to debate over which metal should back the dollar: gold and silver, or gold alone.[78] The Coinage Act of 1873 stopped the coinage of silver for all coins worth a dollar or more, effectively tying the dollar to the value of gold. As a result, the money supply contracted and the effects of the Panic of 1873 grew worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had entered into when currency was less valuable.[80] Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both metals, believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values.[81] Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed a bill, which passed the House, that required the United States to coin as much silver as miners could sell the government, thus increasing the money supply and aiding debtors.[78] In the Senate, William B. Allison, a Republican from Iowa offered an amendment to limit the silver coinage to two to four million dollars per month.[78] This was still too much for Blaine, and he denounced the bill and the proposed amendment, but the amended Bland–Allison Act passed the Senate by a 48 to 21 vote.[78] Hayes vetoed the bill, but Congress mustered the two-thirds vote to pass it over his veto.[80] Even after the Bland–Allison Act's passage, Blaine continued his opposition, making a series of speeches against it during the 1878 congressional campaign season.[78]"", ""Hayes had announced early in his presidency that he would not seek another term which meant that the contest for the Republican nomination in 1880 was open to all challengers—including Blaine.[86] Blaine was among the early favorites for the nomination, as were former President Grant, Treasury Secretary John Sherman of Ohio, and Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont.[87] Although Grant did not actively promote his candidacy, his entry into the race re-energized the Stalwarts and when the convention met in Chicago in June 1880, they instantly polarized the delegates into Grant and anti-Grant factions, with Blaine the most popular choice of the latter group.[88] Blaine was nominated by James Frederick Joy of Michigan, but in contrast to Ingersoll's exciting speech of 1876, Joy's lengthy oration was remembered only for its maladroitness.[89] After the other candidates were nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; no other candidate had more than Sherman's 93, and none had the required majority of 379.[90] Sherman's delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, but he refused to release them through twenty-eight ballots in the hope that the anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him.[90] Eventually, they did desert Blaine, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to Ohio Congressman James A. Garfield, and by the thirty-sixth ballot he had 399 votes, enough for victory.[90]"", 'Guiteau, a self-professed Stalwart, believed that after assassinating the President, he would strike a blow to unite the two factions of the Republican Party, allowing him to ingratiate himself with Vice President Arthur and receive his coveted position.[102] Guiteau was overpowered and arrested immediately, while Garfield lingered for two and a half months before he died on September 19, 1881. Guiteau was convicted of killing Garfield and hanged on June 30, 1882.[103]', ""In the months leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more considered the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right.[114] George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention.[115] John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur's campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman's older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.[116]"", ""William H. West of Ohio nominated Blaine with an enthusiastic speech and after the first ballot, Blaine led the count with 334½ votes.[117] While short of the necessary 417 for nomination, Blaine had far more than any other candidate with Arthur in second place at 278 votes.[117] Blaine was unacceptable to the Arthur delegates just as Blaine's own delegates would never vote for the President, so the contest was between the two for the delegates of the remaining candidates.[117] Blaine's total steadily increased as Logan and Sherman withdrew in his favor and some of the Edmunds delegates defected to him.[117] Unlike in previous conventions, the momentum for Blaine in 1884 would not be halted.[118] On the fourth ballot, Blaine received 541 votes and was, at last, nominated.[118] Logan was named vice presidential nominee on the first ballot, and the Republicans had their ticket.[118]""]"

So popular were Pollock\'s books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that ""Enid Blyton had better look to her laurels"".[29] But Blyton\'s readers were not so easily deceived and many complained about the subterfuge to her and her publisher,[29] with the result that all six books published under the name of Mary Pollock\xa0– two in 1940 and four in 1943\xa0– were reissued under Blyton\'s name.[30] Later in 1940 Blyton published the first of her boarding school story books and the first novel in the Naughtiest Girl series, The Naughtiest Girl in the School, which followed the exploits of the mischievous schoolgirl Elizabeth Allen at the fictional Whyteleafe School. The first of her six novels in the St. Clare\'s series, The Twins at St. Clare\'s, appeared the following year, featuring the twin sisters Patricia and Isabel O\'Sullivan.[15]', 'In 1942 Blyton released the first book in the Mary Mouse series, Mary Mouse and the Dolls\' House, about a mouse exiled from her mousehole who becomes a maid at a dolls\' house. Twenty-three books in the series were produced between 1942 and 1964; 10,000 copies were sold in 1942 alone.[31] The same year, Blyton published the first novel in the Famous Five series, Five on a Treasure Island, with illustrations by Eileen Soper. Its popularity resulted in twenty-one books between then and 1963, and the characters of Julian, Dick, Anne, George (Georgina) and Timmy the dog became household names in Britain.[32] Matthew Grenby, author of Children\'s Literature, states that the five were involved with ""unmasking hardened villains and solving serious crimes"", although the novels were ""hardly \'hard-boiled\' thrillers"".[33] Blyton based the character of Georgina, a tomboy she described as ""short-haired, freckled, sturdy, and snub-nosed"" and ""bold and daring, hot-tempered and loyal"", on herself.[11]', ""Blyton had an interest in biblical narratives, and retold Old and New Testament stories. The Land of Far-Beyond (1942) is a Christian parable along the lines of John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1698), with contemporary children as the main characters.[34] In 1943 she published The Children's Life of Christ, a collection of fifty-nine short stories related to the life of Jesus, with her own slant on popular biblical stories, from the Nativity and the Three Wise Men through to the trial, the crucifixion and the resurrection.[35] Tales from the Bible was published the following year,[36] followed by The Boy with the Loaves and Fishes in 1948.[37]"", ""The Enid Blyton Trust for Children was established in 1982, with Imogen as its first chairman,[114] and in 1985 it established the National Library for the Handicapped Child.[7] Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine began publication in September 1985 and, on 14 October 1992, the BBC began publishing Noddy Magazine and released the Noddy CD-Rom in October 1996.[1]"", ""Blyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to celebrate the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall.[118] In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, Mr Tumpy's Caravan, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books in a collection of papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death.[119][120] It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.[120][121]"", 'From the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC operated a de facto ban on dramatising Blyton\'s books for radio, considering her to be a ""second-rater"" whose work was without literary merit.[136][137][f] The children\'s literary critic Margery Fisher likened Blyton\'s books to ""slow poison"",[7] and Jean E.

He was baptised there under the name Barthélemy in late 1922.[15][c] He later wrote, ""To be a Christian meant for me to free myself from ancestral customs, to become a brother of humanity"".[3] At Saint Paul he learned French, the catechism, and agricultural labour. By mid-1924 Boganda had completed his primary education and had indicated his desire to become a priest. In November he was sent to the Jesuit petit séminaire in Lemfu, Belgian Congo. The school\'s curriculum included Latin, French, mathematics, history, and philosophy and was scheduled to take six years to complete, though Boganda had left by 1928/1929.[15][d] After failing to enroll in a school in France due to lack of money, he entered the Spiritian petit séminaire in Brazzaville. He spent his final year of studies in Bangui, where he was tutored by Monsignor Marcel Grandin, the head of the Catholic Church in Oubangui-Chari.[20] Once this was completed, Grandin enrolled Boganda in the Saint Laurent grand séminaire in Mvolyé, Yaoundé, French Cameroon, in 1931. The first African student at the school, he learned history, Latin, philosophy, theology, and other subjects.[21]', ""After World War II, Boganda was urged by Grandin to involve himself in politics.[3] In particular, Grandin hoped he would seek election to the National Assembly of France. Some Oubanguians had already indicated that they would support Boganda if he contested a seat in the assembly, and Grandin hoped that Boganda could preserve the interests of the Catholic Church from the local growth of Protestantism and increasing leftist and anti-colonial thought in both France and its colonies.[26] Boganda decided to compete, and on 10 November 1946, he was elected deputy for Oubangui-Chari,[27] becoming the first native Oubanguian to join the assembly after winning 10,846 votes—almost half of the total votes cast—and defeating three other candidates, including the incumbent, François Joseph Reste, who had formerly served as the Governor-General of French Equatorial Africa. Formally, Boganda identified with the Popular Republican Movement (MRP). His election was confirmed on 20 December and he was made a member of the Assembly's Overseas Territories Commission and the Supply Commission.[3] He arrived in Paris attired in his clerical garb and introduced himself to his fellow legislators as the son of a polygamous cannibal,[28] probably in a deliberate attempt to project a personal aura of omnipotence.[29] Grandin sought to maintain influence over his former pupil and had requested that the Spiritans in France welcome him, provide lodging, and introduce him to Catholic politicians and keep him away from left-leaning groups. They did not do this, and Boganda expressed disappointment at the lack of a reception upon his arrival and the weak support from French deputies for his proposals to help his constituents in Oubangui-Chari.[30]"", ""Boganda was not particularly concerned with his religious mission once he entered politics, but he used the enormous popular respect for the Catholic Church to his advantage, manipulating religious symbols for political purposes.[48] Boganda's attachment to the clergy weakened when he met and fell in love with a young Frenchwoman, Michelle Jourdain, who was employed as a parliamentary secretary.[32] By 1949 they were cohabitating and Boganda wrote a letter to his Catholic superiors, pointing out that clerical celibacy was a rule created by the Catholic Church and had no biblical basis.[49] On 25 November he was expelled from the priesthood.[50] Despite this, Boganda remained a devout Catholic and sympathetic to missionary interests.[41] The couple was married on 13 June 1950,[32] and would later have two daughters and a son.[3]""]"

Bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research.', ""Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy."", 'Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, now known as the Niels Bohr Institute, which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including Hans Kramers, Oskar Klein, George de Hevesy, and Werner Heisenberg. He predicted the properties of a new zirconium-like element, which was named hafnium, after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the synthetic element bohrium was named after him.', 'During the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from Nazism. After Denmark was occupied by the Germans, he met with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the German nuclear weapon project. In September 1943 word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, so he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957.', 'Niels Henrik David Bohr was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 7 October 1885, the second of three children of Christian Bohr,[1][2] a professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen, and his wife Ellen née Adler, who came from a wealthy Jewish banking family.[3] He had an elder sister, Jenny, and a younger brother Harald.[1] Jenny became a teacher,[2] while Harald became a mathematician and footballer who played for the Danish national team at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. Niels was a passionate footballer as well, and the two brothers played several matches for the Copenhagen-based Akademisk Boldklub (Academic Football Club), with Niels as goalkeeper.[4]', ""Bohr was educated at Gammelholm Latin School, starting when he was seven.[5] In 1903, Bohr enrolled as an undergraduate at Copenhagen University. His major was physics, which he studied under Professor Christian Christiansen, the university's only professor of physics at that time. He also studied astronomy and mathematics under Professor Thorvald Thiele, and philosophy under Professor Harald Høffding, a friend of his father.[6][7]"", ""In 1905 a gold medal competition was sponsored by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to make his own glassware, creating test tubes with the required elliptical cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[8][9][7][10]"", ""Harald became the first of the two Bohr brothers to earn a master's degree, which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his on the electron theory of metals, a topic assigned by his supervisor, Christiansen. Bohr subsequently elaborated his master's thesis into his much-larger Doctor of Philosophy thesis. He surveyed the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by Paul Drude and elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz, in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the Hall effect, and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The thesis was accepted in April 1911,[11] and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year.[12] Bohr's thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen would independently derive a theorem in Bohr's thesis that is today known as the Bohr–Van Leeuwen theorem.[13]"", ""In 1910, Bohr met Margrethe Nørlund, the sister of the mathematician Niels Erik Nørlund.[14] Bohr resigned his membership in the Church of Denmark on 16 April 1912, and he and Margrethe were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall in Slagelse on 1 August.

J. Thomson of the Cavendish Laboratory and Trinity College, Cambridge. He attended lectures on electromagnetism given by James Jeans and Joseph Larmor, and did some research on cathode rays, but failed to impress Thomson.[24][25] He had more success with younger physicists like the Australian William Lawrence Bragg,[26] and New Zealand\'s Ernest Rutherford, whose 1911 small central nucleus Rutherford model of the atom had challenged Thomson\'s 1904 plum pudding model.[27] Bohr received an invitation from Rutherford to conduct post-doctoral work at Victoria University of Manchester,[28] where Bohr met George de Hevesy and Charles Galton Darwin (whom Bohr referred to as ""the grandson of the real Darwin"").[29]', 'Bohr returned to Denmark in July 1912 for his wedding, and travelled around England and Scotland on his honeymoon. On his return, he became a privatdocent at the University of Copenhagen, giving lectures on thermodynamics. Martin Knudsen put Bohr\'s name forward for a docent, which was approved in July 1913, and Bohr then began teaching medical students.[30] His three papers, which later became famous as ""the trilogy"",[28] were published in Philosophical Magazine in July, September and November of that year.[31][32][33][34] He adapted Rutherford\'s nuclear structure to Max Planck\'s quantum theory and so created his Bohr model of the atom.[32]', 'Planetary models of atoms were not new, but Bohr\'s treatment was.[35] Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin on the role of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point,[36][37] he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in orbits of quantized ""stationary states"" around the atom\'s nucleus in order to stabilize the atom, but it wasn\'t until his 1921 paper that he showed that the chemical properties of each element were largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms.[38][39][40][41] He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.[42]', 'In 1885, Johann Balmer had come up with his Balmer series to describe the visible spectral lines of a hydrogen atom:', ""where λ is the wavelength of the absorbed or emitted light and RH is the Rydberg constant.[43] Balmer's formula was corroborated by the discovery of additional spectral lines, but for thirty years, no one could explain why it worked. In the first paper of his trilogy, Bohr was able to derive it from his model:"", ""where me is the electron's mass, e is its charge, h is Planck's constant and Z is the atom's atomic number (1 for hydrogen).[44]"", ""The model's first hurdle was the Pickering series, lines which did not fit Balmer's formula. When challenged on this by Alfred Fowler, Bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium, helium atoms with only one electron. The Bohr model was found to work for such ions.[44] Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and Hendrik Lorentz, did not like the trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, David Hilbert, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Max Born and Arnold Sommerfeld saw it as a breakthrough.[45][46] The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments.[47][48] Today, the Bohr model of the atom has been superseded, but is still the best known model of the atom, as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.[49]"", ""The model's first hurdle was the Pickering series, lines which did not fit Balmer's formula.

He later admitted that he was not a good lecturer, because he needed a balance between clarity and truth, between ""Klarheit und Wahrheit"".[50] He decided to return to Manchester, where Rutherford had offered him a job as a reader in place of Darwin, whose tenure had expired. Bohr accepted. He took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen, which he started by taking a holiday in Tyrol with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler. There, he visited the University of Göttingen and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he met Sommerfeld and conducted seminars on the trilogy. The First World War broke out while they were in Tyrol, greatly complicating the trip back to Denmark and Bohr\'s subsequent voyage with Margrethe to England, where he arrived in October 1914. They stayed until July 1916, by which time he had been appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, a position created especially for him. His docentship was abolished at the same time, so he still had to teach physics to medical students. New professors were formally introduced to King Christian X, who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player.[51]', ""In April 1917, Bohr began a campaign to establish an Institute of Theoretical Physics. He gained the support of the Danish government and the Carlsberg Foundation, and sizeable contributions were also made by industry and private donors, many of them Jewish. Legislation establishing the institute was passed in November 1918. Now known as the Niels Bohr Institute, it opened on 3 March 1921, with Bohr as its director. His family moved into an apartment on the first floor.[52][53] Bohr's institute served as a focal point for researchers into quantum mechanics and related subjects in the 1920s and 1930s, when most of the world's best-known theoretical physicists spent some time in his company. Early arrivals included Hans Kramers from the Netherlands, Oskar Klein from Sweden, George de Hevesy from Hungary, Wojciech Rubinowicz from Poland, and Svein Rosseland from Norway. Bohr became widely appreciated as their congenial host and eminent colleague.[54][55] Klein and Rosseland produced the institute's first publication even before it opened.[53]"", 'The Bohr model worked well for hydrogen and ionized single-electron helium which impressed Einstein[56][57] but could not explain more complex elements. By 1919, Bohr was moving away from the idea that electrons orbited the nucleus and developed heuristics to describe them. The rare-earth elements posed a particular classification problem for chemists because they were so chemically similar. An important development came in 1924 with Wolfgang Pauli\'s discovery of the Pauli exclusion principle, which put Bohr\'s models on a firm theoretical footing. Bohr was then able to declare that the as-yet-undiscovered element 72 was not a rare-earth element but an element with chemical properties similar to those of zirconium. (Elements had been predicted and discovered since 1871 by chemical properties[58]), and Bohr was immediately challenged by the French chemist Georges Urbain, who claimed to have discovered a rare-earth element 72, which he called ""celtium."" At the Institute in Copenhagen, Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy took up the challenge of proving Bohr right and Urbain wrong. Starting with a clear idea of the chemical properties of the unknown element greatly simplified the search process. They went through samples from Copenhagen\'s Museum of Mineralogy looking for a zirconium-like element and soon found it. The element, which they named hafnium (hafnia being the Latin name for Copenhagen), turned out to be more common than gold.[59][60]', 'In 1922, Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics ""for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them.""[61] The award thus recognized both the trilogy and his early leading work in the emerging field of quantum mechanics. For his Nobel lecture, Bohr gave his audience a comprehensive survey of what was then known about the structure of the atom, including the correspondence principle, which he had formulated. This states that the behavior of systems described by quantum theory reproduces classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers.[62]', 'The discovery of Compton scattering by Arthur Holly Compton in 1923 convinced most physicists that light was composed of photons and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons. In 1924, Bohr, Kramers, and John C. Slater, an American physicist working at the Institute in Copenhagen, proposed the Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory (BKS). It was more of a program than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively. The BKS theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation on the basis of the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field.[63][64]', 'Modelling atomic behaviour under incident electromagnetic radiation using ""virtual oscillators"" at the absorption and emission frequencies, rather than the (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, Werner Heisenberg and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They led to the development of matrix mechanics, the first form of modern quantum mechanics. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory.[65] The most provocative element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger.[66] In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that ""there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible"".[67]', 'Modelling atomic behaviour under incident electromagnetic radiation using ""virtual oscillators"" at the absorption and emission frequencies, rather than the (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, Werner Heisenberg and Kramers to explore different mathematical models.

The next month, Bohr travelled to Leiden to attend celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Hendrick Lorentz receiving his doctorate. When his train stopped in Hamburg, he was met by Wolfgang Pauli and Otto Stern, who asked for his opinion of the spin theory. Bohr pointed out that he had concerns about the interaction between electrons and magnetic fields. When he arrived in Leiden, Paul Ehrenfest and Albert Einstein informed Bohr that Einstein had resolved this problem using relativity. Bohr then had Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit incorporate this into their paper. Thus, when he met Werner Heisenberg and Pascual Jordan in Göttingen on the way back, he had become, in his own words, ""a prophet of the electron magnet gospel"".[68]', 'Heisenberg first came to Copenhagen in 1924, then returned to Göttingen in June 1925, shortly thereafter developing the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. When he showed his results to Max Born in Göttingen, Born realised that they could best be expressed using matrices. This work attracted the attention of the British physicist Paul Dirac,[69] who came to Copenhagen for six months in September 1926. Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger also visited in 1926. His attempt at explaining quantum physics in classical terms using wave mechanics impressed Bohr, who believed it contributed ""so much to mathematical clarity and simplicity that it represents a gigantic advance over all previous forms of quantum mechanics"".[70]', 'Heisenberg first came to Copenhagen in 1924, then returned to Göttingen in June 1925, shortly thereafter developing the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.

Bohr was dissatisfied with Heisenberg\'s argument, since it required only that a measurement disturb properties that already existed, rather than the more radical idea that the electron\'s properties could not be discussed at all apart from the context they were measured in. In a paper presented at the Volta Conference at Como in September 1927, Bohr emphasized that Heisenberg\'s uncertainty relations could be derived from classical considerations about the resolving power of optical instruments.[76] Understanding the true meaning of complementarity would, Bohr believed, require ""closer investigation"".[77] Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. Philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. Einstein and Bohr had good-natured arguments over such issues throughout their lives.[78]', 'In 1914 Carl Jacobsen, the heir to Carlsberg breweries, bequeathed his mansion (the Carlsberg Honorary Residence, currently known as Carlsberg Academy) to be used for life by the Dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science, literature or the arts, as an honorary residence (Danish: Æresbolig). Harald Høffding had been the first occupant, and upon his death in July 1931, the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters gave Bohr occupancy. He and his family moved there in 1932.[79] He was elected president of the Academy on 17 March 1939.[80]', ""By 1929 the phenomenon of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr to create a new theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.[81][82]"", 'The discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner) generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought the news to the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939.[83] When Bohr told George Placzek that this resolved all the mysteries of transuranic elements, Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to Placzek, Léon Rosenfeld and John Wheeler that ""I have understood everything.""[84] Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr concluded that it was the uranium-235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium-238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940, John R. Dunning demonstrated that Bohr was correct.[83] In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on ""The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission"".[85]', 'Heisenberg said of Bohr that he was ""primarily a philosopher, not a physicist"".[86] Bohr read the 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in The Making of the Atomic Bomb that Bohr was influenced by Kierkegaard through Høffding.[87] In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard\'s Stages on Life\'s Way as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, ""It is the only thing I have to send home; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better\xa0... I even think it is one of the most delightful things I have ever read."" Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard\'s language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard\'s philosophy.[88] Some of Bohr\'s biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard\'s advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.[89][90][91]', ""There has been some dispute over the extent to which Kierkegaard influenced Bohr's philosophy and science. David Favrholdt argued that Kierkegaard had minimal influence over Bohr's work, taking Bohr's statement about disagreeing with Kierkegaard at face value,[92] while Jan Faye argued that one can disagree with the content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure.[93][88]"", ""There has been much subsequent debate and discussion about Bohr's views and philosophy of quantum mechanics.[94] Regarding his ontological interpretation of the quantum world, Bohr has been seen as an anti-realist, an instrumentalist, a phenomenological realist or some other kind of realist. Furthermore, though some have seen Bohr as being a subjectivist or a positivist, most philosophers agree that this is a misunderstanding of Bohr as he never argued for verificationism or for the idea that the subject had a direct impact on the outcome of a measurement.[95]"", 'Bohr has often been quoted saying that there is ""no quantum world"" but only an ""abstract quantum physical description"". This was not said by Bohr, but rather by Aage Petersen attempting to summarize Bohr\'s philosophy in a reminiscence after his death. N. David Mermin recalled Victor Weisskopf declaring that Bohr wouldn\'t have said anything of the sort and exclaiming, ""Shame on Aage Petersen for putting those ridiculous words in Bohr\'s mouth!""[96]', 'Numerous scholars have argued that the philosophy of Immanuel Kant had a strong influence on Bohr. Like Kant, Bohr thought distinguishing between the subject\'s experience and the object was an important condition for attaining knowledge. This can only be done through the use of causal and spatial-temporal concepts to describe the subject\'s experience.[95] Thus, according to Jan Faye, Bohr thought that it is because of ""classical"" concepts like ""space"", ""position"", ""time,"" ""causation"", and ""momentum"" that one can talk about objects and their objective existence. Bohr held that basic concepts like ""time"" are built in to our ordinary language and that the concepts of classical physics are merely a refinement of them.[95] Therefore, for Bohr, classical concepts need to be used to describe experiments that deal with the quantum world. Bohr writes:', ""[T]he account of all evidence must be expressed in classical terms. The argument is simply that by the word 'experiment' we refer to a situation where we can tell to others what we have done and what we have learned and that, therefore, the account of the experimental arrangement and of the results of the observations must be expressed in unambiguous language with suitable application of the terminology of classical physics (APHK, p. 39).[95]"", 'According to Faye, there are various explanations for why Bohr believed that classical concepts were necessary for describing quantum phenomena. Faye groups explanations into five frameworks: empiricism (i.e. logical positivism); Kantianism (or Neo-Kantian models of epistemology); Pragmatism (which focus on how human beings experientially interact with atomic systems according to their needs and interests); Darwinianism (i.e. we are adapted to use classical type concepts, which Léon Rosenfeld said that we evolved to use); and Experimentalism (which focuses strictly on the function and outcome of experiments which thus must be described classically).[95] These explanations are not mutually exclusive, and at times Bohr seems to emphasize some of these aspects while at other times he focuses on other elements.[95]', 'According to Faye ""Bohr thought of the atom as real. Atoms are neither heuristic nor logical constructions."" However, according to Faye, he did not believe ""that the quantum mechanical formalism was true in the sense that it gave us a literal (\'pictorial\') rather than a symbolic representation of the quantum world.""[95] Therefore, Bohr\'s theory of complementarity ""is first and foremost a semantic and epistemological reading of quantum mechanics that carries certain ontological implications.""[95] As Faye explains, Bohr\'s indefinability thesis is that', '[T]he truth conditions of sentences ascribing a certain kinematic or dynamic value to an atomic object are dependent on the apparatus involved, in such a way that these truth conditions have to include reference to the experimental setup as well as the actual outcome of the experiment.[95]', 'Faye notes that Bohr\'s interpretation makes no reference to a ""collapse of the wave function during measurements"" (and indeed, he never mentioned this idea). Instead, Bohr ""accepted the Born statistical interpretation because he believed that the ψ-function has only a symbolic meaning and does not represent anything real."" Since for Bohr, the ψ-function is not a literal pictorial representation of reality, there can be no real collapse of the wavefunction.[95]', 'Faye notes that Bohr\'s interpretation makes no reference to a ""collapse of the wave function during measurements"" (and indeed, he never mentioned this idea). Instead, Bohr ""accepted the Born statistical interpretation because he believed that the ψ-function has only a symbolic meaning and does not represent anything real."" Since for Bohr, the ψ-function is not a literal pictorial representation of reality, there can be no real collapse of the wavefunction.[95]', 'A much debated point in recent literature is what Bohr believed about atoms and their reality and whether they are something else than what they seem to be. Some like Henry Folse argue that Bohr saw a distinction between observed phenomena and a transcendental reality. Jan Faye disagrees with this position and holds that for Bohr, the quantum formalism and complementarity was the only thing we could say about the quantum world and that ""there is no further evidence in Bohr\'s writings indicating that Bohr would attribute intrinsic and measurement-independent state properties to atomic objects [...] in addition to the classical ones being manifested in measurement.""[95]', 'The rise of Nazism in Germany prompted many scholars to flee their countries, either because they were Jewish or because they were political opponents of the Nazi regime. In 1933, the Rockefeller Foundation created a fund to help support refugee academics, and Bohr discussed this programme with the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, Max Mason, in May 1933 during a visit to the United States. Bohr offered the refugees temporary jobs at the institute, provided them with financial support, arranged for them to be awarded fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, and ultimately found them places at institutions around the world. Those that he helped included Guido Beck, Felix Bloch, James Franck, George de Hevesy, Otto Frisch, Hilde Levi, Lise Meitner, George Placzek, Eugene Rabinowitch, Stefan Rozental, Erich Ernst Schneider, Edward Teller, Arthur von Hippel and Victor Weisskopf.[97]', ""In April 1940, early in the Second World War, Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Denmark.[98] To prevent the Germans from discovering Max von Laue's and James Franck's gold Nobel medals, Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in aqua regia. In this form, they were stored on a shelf at the Institute until after the war, when the gold was precipitated and the medals re-struck by the Nobel Foundation. Bohr's own medal had been donated to an auction to the Finnish Relief Fund, and was auctioned off in March 1940, along with the medal of August Krogh. The buyer later donated the two medals to the Danish Historical Museum in Frederiksborg Castle, where they are still kept.[99]"", 'Bohr kept the Institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.[100]', ""Bohr was aware of the possibility of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235.[101] In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.\nAccording to Heisenberg, he began to address nuclear energy, morality and the war, to which Bohr seems to have reacted by terminating the conversation abruptly while not giving Heisenberg hints about his own opinions.[102] Ivan Supek, one of Heisenberg's students and friends, claimed that the main subject of the meeting was Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who had proposed trying to persuade Bohr to mediate peace between Britain and Germany.[103]"", ""In 1957, Heisenberg wrote to Robert Jungk, who was then working on the book Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists. Heisenberg explained that he had visited Copenhagen to communicate to Bohr the views of several German scientists, that production of a nuclear weapon was possible with great efforts, and this raised enormous responsibilities on the world's scientists on both sides.[104] When Bohr saw Jungk's depiction in the Danish translation of the book, he drafted (but never sent) a letter to Heisenberg, stating that he never understood the purpose of Heisenberg's visit, was shocked by Heisenberg's opinion that Germany would win the war, and that atomic weapons could be decisive.[105]"", ""Michael Frayn's 1998 play Copenhagen explores what might have happened at the 1941 meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr.[106] A television film version of the play by the BBC was first screened on 26 September 2002, with Stephen Rea as Bohr. The same meeting had previously been dramatised by the BBC's Horizon science documentary series in 1992, with Anthony Bate as Bohr, and Philip Anthony as Heisenberg.[107] The meeting is also dramatized in the Norwegian/Danish/British miniseries The Heavy Water War.[108]"", ""In September 1943, word reached Bohr and his brother Harald that the Nazis considered their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, and that they were therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September.[109][110] The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events.[110][111][112][113] Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.[114]"", ""When the news of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a telegram to Bohr asking him to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).[115][116] The Mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's bomb bay.[117] During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly Norway. He passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the North Sea.[118][119][120] Bohr's son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.[121]"", 'Bohr was warmly received by James Chadwick and Sir John Anderson, but for security reasons Bohr was kept out of sight. He was given an apartment at St James\'s Palace and an office with the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons development team. Bohr was astonished at the amount of progress that had been made.[121][122] Chadwick arranged for Bohr to visit the United States as a Tube Alloys consultant, with Aage as his assistant.[123] On 8 December 1943, Bohr arrived in Washington, D.C., where he met with the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr. He visited Einstein and Pauli at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and went to Los Alamos in New Mexico, where the nuclear weapons were being designed.[124] For security reasons, he went under the name of ""Nicholas Baker"" in the United States, while Aage became ""James Baker"".[125] In May 1944 the Danish resistance newspaper De frie Danske reported that they had learned that \'the famous son of Denmark Professor Niels Bohr\' in October the previous year had fled his country via Sweden to London and from there travelled to Moscow from where he could be assumed to support the war effort.[126]', 'Bohr did not remain at Los Alamos, but paid a series of extended visits over the course of the next two years. Robert Oppenheimer credited Bohr with acting ""as a scientific father figure to the younger men"", most notably Richard Feynman.[127] Bohr is quoted as saying, ""They didn\'t need my help in making the atom bomb.""[128] Oppenheimer gave Bohr credit for an important contribution to the work on modulated neutron initiators. ""This device remained a stubborn puzzle,"" Oppenheimer noted, ""but in early February 1945 Niels Bohr clarified what had to be done.""[127]', 'Bohr recognised early that nuclear weapons would change international relations. In April 1944, he received a letter from Peter Kapitza, written some months before when Bohr was in Sweden, inviting him to come to the Soviet Union. The letter convinced Bohr that the Soviets were aware of the Anglo-American project, and would strive to catch up. He sent Kapitza a non-committal response, which he showed to the authorities in Britain before posting.[129] Bohr met Churchill on 16 May 1944, but found that ""we did not speak the same language"".[130] Churchill disagreed with the idea of openness towards the Russians to the point that he wrote in a letter: ""It seems to me Bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made to see that he is very near the edge of mortal crimes.""[131]', 'Oppenheimer suggested that Bohr visit President Franklin D. Roosevelt to convince him that the Manhattan Project should be shared with the Soviets in the hope of speeding up its results. Bohr\'s friend, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, informed President Roosevelt about Bohr\'s opinions, and a meeting between them took place on 26 August 1944. Roosevelt suggested that Bohr return to the United Kingdom to try to win British approval.[132][133] When Churchill and Roosevelt met at Hyde Park on 19 September 1944, they rejected the idea of informing the world about the project, and the aide-mémoire of their conversation contained a rider that ""enquiries should be made regarding the activities of Professor Bohr and steps taken to ensure that he is responsible for no leakage of information, particularly to the Russians"".[134]', 'In June 1950, Bohr addressed an ""Open Letter"" to the United Nations calling for international cooperation on nuclear energy.[135][136][137] In the 1950s, after the Soviet Union\'s first nuclear weapon test, the International Atomic Energy Agency was created along the lines of Bohr\'s suggestion.[138] In 1957 he received the first ever Atoms for Peace Award.[139]', 'Following the ending of the war, Bohr returned to Copenhagen on 25 August 1945, and was re-elected President of the Royal Danish Academy of Arts and Sciences on 21 September.[141] At a memorial meeting of the Academy on 17 October 1947 for King Christian X, who had died in April, the new king, Frederik IX, announced that he was conferring the Order of the Elephant on Bohr. This award was normally awarded only to royalty and heads of state, but the king said that it honoured not just Bohr personally, but Danish science.[142][143] Bohr designed his own coat of arms which featured a taijitu (symbol of yin and yang) and a motto in Latin: contraria sunt complementa, ""opposites are complementary"".[144][143][145]', 'The Second World War demonstrated that science, and physics in particular, now required considerable financial and material resources. To avoid a brain drain to the United States, twelve European countries banded together to create CERN, a research organisation along the lines of the national laboratories in the United States, designed to undertake Big Science projects beyond the resources of any one of them alone. Questions soon arose regarding the best location for the facilities. Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site. Pierre Auger, who organised the preliminary discussions, disagreed; he felt that both Bohr and his Institute were past their prime, and that Bohr\'s presence would overshadow others. After a long debate, Bohr pledged his support to CERN in February 1952, and Geneva was chosen as the site in October. The CERN Theory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 1957.[146] Victor Weisskopf, who later became the Director General of CERN, summed up Bohr\'s role, saying that ""there were other personalities who started and conceived the idea of CERN. The enthusiasm and ideas of the other people would not have been enough, however, if a man of his stature had not supported it.""[147][148]', 'Meanwhile, Scandinavian countries formed the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957, with Bohr as its chairman. He was also involved with the founding of the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission, and served as its first chairman from February 1956.[149]', ""Bohr died of heart failure at his home in Carlsberg on 18 November 1962.[150] He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the Assistens Cemetery in the Nørrebro section of Copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother Harald, and his son Christian. Years later, his wife's ashes were also interred there.[151] On 7 October 1965, on what would have been his 80th birthday, the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen was officially renamed to what it had been called unofficially for many years: the Niels Bohr Institute.[152][153]"", ""Bohr died of heart failure at his home in Carlsberg on 18 November 1962.[150] He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the Assistens Cemetery in the Nørrebro section of Copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother Harald, and his son Christian.

In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received the Hughes Medal in 1921, the Matteucci Medal in 1923, the Franklin Medal in 1926,[154] the Copley Medal in 1938, the Order of the Elephant in 1947, the Atoms for Peace Award in 1957 and the Sonning Prize in 1961.

Several other countries have also issued postage stamps depicting Bohr.[161] In 1997, the Danish National Bank began circulating the 500-krone banknote with the portrait of Bohr smoking a pipe.[162][163] On 7 October 2012, in celebration of Niels Bohr's 127th birthday, a Google Doodle depicting the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom appeared on Google's home page.[164] An asteroid, 3948 Bohr, was named after him,[165] as was the Bohr lunar crater and bohrium, the chemical element with atomic number 107.[166]""]"

The President of the Congo posthumously awarded Bolikango a medal in 2005 for his long career in public service.', ""Jean Bolikango was born in Léopoldville, Belgian Congo, on 4 February 1909[1] to a Bangala family from Équateur Province.[2][a] In 1917 he enrolled in St. Joseph's Institute, graduating in December 1925 after six years of primary school, two years of pedagogical studies, and one year of stenography and typing courses.[1] He became a licensed primary school teacher the following year.[2] Bolikango taught at Scheutist schools[1] and finally St. Joseph's Institute until 1958. He instructed a total of 1,300 students,[4] including future Prime Minister Joseph Iléo, future Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula, future Minister of Finance Arthur Pinzi, future Minister of Social Affairs Jacques Massa,[5] future dramatist Albert Mongita, and future Catholic Cardinal Joseph Malula.[1] In 1946 he became the president of the Association des Anciens élèves des pères de Scheut[b] (ADAPÉS), a position he held until his death.[4]"", 'In his opening address at the congress, Bolikango said that while ""parties based on ethnic foundations"" made the first step toward a unified Congo, the ""national interest"" of the country rested upon a ""unity of will"". He enumerated that this ""does not mean that each ethnic group must abandon its own characteristics, but that through these differences one must endeavour to form a harmonious ensemble.""[8] The UNIMO leadership was skeptical of Bolikango\'s unified outlook for the Congo and remained independent, although he secured the support of the Ngombe, some of the Ngwaka and Bangala, and chiefs from the Lisala, Bongandanga, and Bumba regions.[8] The FUB made an alliance with ASSORECO and FEDUNEC, transforming into the Parti de l\'Unité Nationale[q] (PUNA).[45] In spite of its attempts to garner more national appeal, the new party retained its regional bias and failed to amass substantial outside support, costing Bolikango much of his backing in Léopoldville.[2][8] Still, this reformed political base allowed him to win a position as a national deputy from the Mongala district in the May 1960 national election by 15,000 votes.[4] He used his position as the president of PUNA to mediate a dispute between the party and minority alliances in Équateur and create a coalition provincial government.[47] After the elections PUNA gradually pulled apart into two different wings, one led by Bolikango and the other by Équateur Provincial President Laurent Eketebi.[48]', 'Meanwhile, the MNC sharply criticised Bolikango\'s connections with the Belgians, undermining his reputation in both Équateur and the capital.[5] The Alliance des Bakongo[r] (ABAKO) also despised him due to his support for Catholic missions and the perception that he was ""pro-white"".[17] He spent the month of May touring the Congo, claiming that he had the support of other party leaders in an alliance against Lumumba and the MNC. This opposition alliance was soon announced as the Cartel d\'Union Nationale.[49] As Lumumba was assembling his proposed cabinet, the Chamber of Deputies convened on 21 June to elect its officers. Bolikango made a bid to be President of the Chamber, but lost the vote to the MNC candidate, Joseph Kasongo, 74 to 58.[34][50][s] The subsequent election of the Senate\'s officers also indicated an MNC advantage. Realising that Lumumba\'s bloc controlled Parliament, several members of the Cartel became eager to negotiate for a coalition government so they could share power, especially Bolikango,[52] who hoped to secure the position of Defence Minister. This did not occur,[18] but he did exact a written pledge from Lumumba of support for his bid to become the first President of the Republic of the Congo in exchange for his party\'s backing of Lumumba\'s government.[53]', 'Bolikango faced his former protégé, Joseph Kasa-Vubu of ABAKO, in the parliamentary vote for the presidency. Lumumba realised that the Belgians would only accept him as Prime Minister if Kasa-Vubu held office, so he switched allegiances, privately dismissing Bolikango as a ""pawn of Belgium and a protégé of the Catholics"", and secretly endorsing Kasa-Vubu. Bolikango lost the parliamentary vote 159 to 43[54] and was left infuriated.[55] In addition to Lumumba\'s duplicity, Bolikango also suffered in the election due to his recent association with the colonial administration and his breaking with the Cartel to negotiate with Lumumba.[56] According to his friend, Thomas Kanza, the loss was ""the most bitter failure in his entire career.""[15] He then helped organise an anti-MNC coalition in Parliament.[57]', ""During the Congo Crisis that followed Congolese independence, Bolikango acted as a United States Central Intelligence Agency informant.[59] Early in the crisis he accused Prime Minister Lumumba of ignoring opposition groups and deliberately stifling dissent;[60] on 3 August he officially denounced Lumumba's policies. Five days later he announced that he would support the formation of a separate republic in Équateur Province.[61] In return, Lumumba accused him of plotting the secession of the region.[27] On 1 September Bolikango was arrested in Gemena on Lumumba's orders, ostensibly for committing secessionist activities and planning assassinations of both Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu, and brought to the capital.[t] This led to demonstrations by his supporters throughout the city on the following day.[63] On 5 September the Chamber of Deputies, particularly upset by Bolikango's arrest, passed a resolution demanding that all detained members of Parliament be released.[64] Soon thereafter, President Kasa-Vubu dismissed Lumumba from office and replaced him with Joseph Iléo.[65] Sympathetic soldiers freed Bolikango from his confinement on 6 September.[30] During Iléo's brief first term from 13 to 20 September Bolikango served as Minister of Information and Minister of Defence.[42] In December he attended a Francophone-African conference in Brazzaville as part of a Congolese government delegation.[66]"", ""During the Congo Crisis that followed Congolese independence, Bolikango acted as a United States Central Intelligence Agency informant.[59] Early in the crisis he accused Prime Minister Lumumba of ignoring opposition groups and deliberately stifling dissent;[60] on 3 August he officially denounced Lumumba's policies.

The plans dissolved after Gizenga was arrested in January 1962.[71] On 13 February Bolikango was appointed Deputy Prime Minister.[72] On 12 July Adoula downsized his government and dismissed him from his post.[24] He then re-entered the parliamentary opposition and, by August, was working with Rémy Mwamba and Christophe Gbenye (both ex-ministers also dismissed from Adoula\'s government) to try and secure support to dislodge Adoula. Bolikango was the opposition\'s favorite to replace the Prime Minister.[73] In 1963 following the defeat of Katanga, he managed to organise an opposition coalition to Adoula\'s government, consisting of ABAKO, leftist followers of Lumumba (by then killed) and Gizenga, and Tshombe\'s Confédération des associations tribales du Katanga[v] (CONAKAT).[18] He also foiled an attempt by one of Adoula\'s ministers to establish a pro-government party in Équateur.[74] That year Parliament was adjourned and Bolikango\'s term as a national deputy ended.[75] In late 1963 Laurent Eketebi left PUNA and allied himself with the Budja tribal minority in the provincial assembly, destroying the concept of a unified Bangala tribe that Bolikango had used to elevate his social and political standing.[76]', 'Sociologist Ludo De Witte wrote of Bolikango as a ""neo-colonial"" politician who was ""short-sighted and power-crazy"".[86] Bolikango is remembered in the Congo as one of the ""fathers of independence"".[87][88] The Fondation Jean Bolikango[z] was created by Bolikango\'s grandson in his memory.

After dropping out of the University of Florida for financial reasons in 1941, he joined the US Navy and trained as a Marine Corps pilot. Sent to the Pacific Theater of Operations, he flew an F4U Corsair during the campaigns in the Marshall Islands and New Guinea, claiming six victories against Japanese A6M Zeros.', 'Bolt continued his service through the Korean War, entering combat through an exchange program with the United States Air Force (USAF) in late 1952. Over a period of several weeks in mid-1953, he led flights of F-86 Sabres into combat with MiG-15s of the Chinese Air Force, scoring six victories during fights along the northern border of North Korea, commonly known as ""MiG Alley,"" giving him a total of 12 victories over his career.', ""Bolt left for basic training in June 1941. Though he intended to join the US Marine Corps, he signed up for the US Navy Flight Training Program, which would allow him to fly for the Marines. On completion of his basic training in November 1941, he was selected as a pilot, and moved to Naval Air Station Atlanta, Georgia in February 1942. He was placed on active duty just before the attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States' entry into World War II.[7] Completing his initial pilot training and transferring to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida for the next phase, he started flight training in the SNJ Texan. He also qualified to fly in the N3N Canary trainer aircraft. His final phase of flight lessons occurred in Naval Air Station Miami in Miami, Florida, where he flew the Grumman F3F, a biplane which was the navy's most advanced trainer at the time. Bolt completed this training on 18 July 1942, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps, receiving his aviator wings that day as well.[4]"", ""Six weeks later, Bolt again turned down his R&R and joined the 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, flying the F-86 Sabre.[27] Ruddell assigned him to First Lieutenant Joseph C. McConnell, who would be the top ace in the war. Bolt and McConnell quickly established a close friendship in spite of Bolt's superior rank, and he attributed his success in Korea to McConnell's guidance. Ruddell sent a request to Lieutenant General Glenn O. Barcus, commander of the Fifth United States Air Force, that Bolt's tour with the squadron be extended. The request was granted, and McConnell and Bolt began going on combat missions together as wingmen in MiG Alley, the area in northwestern Korea where air-to-air combat was most frequent.[28] Bolt's Sabre, tail number 52-2582, was named Darling Dottie.[29]"", 'By May, McConnell was rotated back to the United States and Bolt was given charge of the flight; in 16 combat missions and 27 combat hours, his flight had never engaged any MiG fighters. This changed on 16 May, when the flight was attacked by a group of MiG fighters at 45,000 feet (14,000\xa0m). He was quickly tailed by one of the aircraft, but managed to avoid its fire and tail another MiG himself. With several well placed shots, Bolt forced its pilot to bail out. Six days later on 22 May, MiG aircraft attacked again, and he managed to outmaneuver a fighter which had been attacking his wingman and shoot it down at 7,000 feet (2,100\xa0m).[30] On 24 June, he flew his 31st combat mission, during which he engaged a single MiG and shot it down after a quick battle in the vicinity of the Yalu River.[30] A week later on 30 June, he was flying another mission in the same area when he spotted and quickly shot down another MiG. By the end of the month, he had credit for four victories and two aircraft ""damaged"".[26]', 'On 11 July, Bolt led another flight of four fighters in a reconnaissance mission above Sinuiju, his 37th combat mission of the deployment.[26] Two of the aircraft departed after their fuel tanks were depleted, leaving him with one wingman to continue the patrol.[31] Soon after, the two pilots spotted a formation of four MiGs taking off from Antung airfield on the Chinese side of the Yalu River. Despite being low on fuel, Bolt ordered an attack. He made a head-on dive toward the formation, which was attempting to gain altitude, and downed the leading airplane with four machine gun bursts.[32] He then banked his aircraft and aimed for the second aircraft in the formation, continuing the attack and scoring hits on its fuselage. The pilot bailed out, and the remaining two MiGs fled.[33] Within the first five minutes of the engagement, Bolt shot down two of the MiGs. This brought his tally of confirmed victories during the war to six.[26] For these actions he became the final Marine aviator to be awarded the Navy Cross during the war.[31] Bolt is the only non-USAF pilot to become an ace in the F-86 and the only naval aviator to become an ace in two wars.[29] Shortly after this final mission, his tour of duty ended and he was rotated back to the United States for an extended rest and vacation, which he spent with his family.[26]', 'Bolt scored a total of 12 confirmed aerial victories during his career, with an additional ""probable"" victory and two aircraft damaged.[36] He was the only U.S. Marine Corps pilot to become an ace in the Korean War,[37] and remains the only U.S. Marine Corps pilot to be an ace in two wars.[36] Bolt was one of 1,297 World War II aces from the United States with six confirmed victories during that war.

Sighting four hostile jet interceptors immediately after the second section of his four-plane flight was forced to retire from the area because of a low fuel supply during a reconnaissance mission deep in enemy territory. Major Bolt quickly maneuvered his aircraft and that of his wingman into attack position and deliberately engaged the numerically superior enemy in a head-on firing run, destroying one of the hostile planes with his initial burst of fire. Although his fuel supply was dangerously low, he initiated repeated attacks on the remaining enemy aircraft and severely damaging the engine section of the lead interceptor, routinely pressed his attack against the crippled plane until the enemy pilot was forced to bail out.

He was a moderately successful batsman who bowled at fast-medium pace for Oxford University between 1898 and 1900. As a student, he made several appearances for Middlesex and achieved a regular place in the county side as an amateur. While playing a tabletop game, Bosanquet devised a new technique for delivering a ball, later named the ""googly"", which he practised during his time at Oxford. He first used it in cricket matches around 1900, abandoning his faster style of bowling, but it was not until 1903, when he had a successful season with the ball, that his new delivery began to attract attention. Having gone on several minor overseas tours, Bosanquet was selected in 1903–04 for the fully representative Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Australia.[note 1] During that tour, he made his Test debut for England and although he largely failed as a batsman, he performed well as a bowler and troubled all the opposing batsmen with his googly.', ""Bosanquet played in the first Test against Australia, making his Test debut for England. Australia batted first and recovered from a poor start to score 285 runs; Bosanquet took the wickets of Warwick Armstrong and Syd Gregory with googlies to finish with two for 52 in 13 overs.[6][38] He scored a single run when he batted, out of an English total of 577. In the second innings he bowled 23 overs and took one for 100. The English bowlers came under heavy punishment from the Australian batsmen; Victor Trumper scored an unbeaten 185 and the team reached 485.[6] Bosanquet had Monty Noble stumped, and Warner later wrote that he was in good form with the ball, beating Trumper with a googly and troubling others.[39] England needed to score 194 to win and Bosanquet came to the wicket with 13 needed to win; he scored one run before the winning hit was made.[40] A hand injury forced Bosanquet to miss the second Test.[41] However, with England 2–0 up in the series, he returned for the third Test. On a very good pitch for batting,[42] Bosanquet took three for 95 in an Australian innings of 388, and none of the batsmen were comfortable batting against his googly.[6][43] When England replied, Bosanquet was out for 10 runs, hitting a poor shot as his team were bowled out for 245.[44] In Australia's second innings, Bosanquet bowled badly at first, delivering full tosses and long hops at the end of the third day's play. Next morning, his bowling improved as he established a good length, delivering a spell of seven overs in which he took four wickets for 23 runs, again causing confusion with his googly.[45] He finished the innings with figures of four for 73.

He also claimed to have been the first Union soldier wounded by enemy action in the Civil War, stating that he received a bruise on the forehead from an object thrown by a Confederate sympathizer while his unit was marching through Baltimore in April 1861.', 'On April 15, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called for 50,000 volunteers to fight to preserve the Union. The following day, Bosbyshell joined the Washington Artillerists, a local militia company, which quickly set out for Washington. En route, the company had to march through the streets of Baltimore on April 17. A hostile crowd of Confederate sympathizers gathered; according to accounts in his lifetime, he was struck by a missile variously described as a stone or a brick. Although it gave him a large bruise and momentarily stunned him, the object drew no blood; Private Bosbyshell was purportedly the first man wounded in the Union cause, while an African-American servant, hit a few minutes later by a missile which broke the skin, was deemed the first man to have shed his blood for the Union.[1][4]  However, official records do not list Bosbyshell among the casualties of the Baltimore riots.[5]', 'In Washington, the company was quartered in the Ladies\' Gallery of the Senate Chamber, in the Capitol.[1] The 350 Pennsylvania troops who first reached Washington on April 18 became known as the First Defenders and, after the war, the survivors formed an association with that name.[2] While they were lodged at the Capitol, President Lincoln, Secretary of State William H. Seward, and Secretary of War Simon Cameron visited. Bosbyshell recalled Lincoln, ""yes, here, towering over all in the room was the great central figure of the war. I remember how I was impressed by the kindliness of his face and awkward hanging of his arms and legs, his apparent bashfulness in the presence of these first soldiers of the Republic, and with it all a grave, rather mournful bearing in his attitude.""[6]', ""In 1869, Bosbyshell was hired as Register of Deposits of the Philadelphia Mint, and moved to that city. The Chief Coiner, A. Loudon Snowden, was impressed by Bosbyshell, and promoted him to Assistant Coiner in 1872. When Snowden left the Mint to accept a position as postmaster in 1876, President Ulysses Grant promoted Bosbyshell in his place.[13] Grant nominated Bosbyshell on December 14, 1876; he was confirmed by the Senate on December 26.[14]  According to numismatic historian Q. David Bowers, Bosbyshell, while serving as Chief Coiner, used Mint facilities and out-of-date dies to strike rare three-dollar pieces, including the 1873, 1875, and 1876 issues. During Bosbyshell's tenure, quantities of pattern coins, restrikes, and pieces struck in different metals flowed to well-connected collectors and dealers, and Bosbyshell sold a large personal collection of such pieces shortly after leaving office.[15]"", ""On October 17, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison commissioned Bosbyshell as superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint. As the Senate was not sitting, Bosbyshell received a recess appointment.[17] Bosbyshell filed his oath of office on November 1, 1889. On his first day on the job, he was greeted with a bouquet of flowers and a large pile of mail from office-seekers. He gave receipts for the Mint property he was now responsible for, and found no errors in the accounts of his predecessor.[18] On December 16, 1889, with the Senate in session, Harrison nominated Bosbyshell.[17] The following day, Vermont Senator Justin Morrill, on behalf of the Senate Finance Committee, to which Bosbyshell's nomination had been referred, recommended that he be confirmed.[19] The Senate did so on December 19.[20]"", 'Bosbyshell had been elected vice-president of the Fidelity National Life Insurance Company in February 1893; in December of that year he was elected treasurer instead, a post he still held as of 1908.[2]  President McKinley appointed him a member of the 1898 Assay Commission.[5]', ""In September 1893, a major theft at the Philadelphia Mint had been discovered.  Henry Cochran, weighing clerk, had been surreptitiously extracting gold bars from a vault sealed in 1887, not with a solid door but with a latticed one that was somewhat loose. Bosbyshell, in taking custody of the Philadelphia Mint's assets from his predecessor, Daniel Fox, had not asked for the gold to be weighed. When the gold was taken out to be converted into coin in 1893, the shortage was discovered. Although some of the gold was recovered, there was still a shortage of $12,810.82, and the government brought suit against Bosbyshell after he left office in 1894, securing judgment against him and the sureties on his bond.  Bosbyshell appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which ruled against him.[32][28] The district court had ruled for Bosbyshell on the matter of 733 silver dollars said to be missing, leaving only the question of the gold.  Bosbyshell asked for review by the Supreme Court, but also sought legislative relief, and on February 2, 1899, Congress absolved him of the debt, making the court case moot.[33]""]"

Kenney created two new formations subordinate to Allied Air Forces Headquarters: the US Fifth Air Force and RAAF Command. Bostock was chosen to be Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command,[10] with twenty-four Australian squadrons at his disposal plus one each from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.[24] The only Australian air combat units in the SWPA not under Bostock's command were those based in New Guinea as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF (No. 9 OG), controlled by Fifth Air Force.[24][25] RAAF Command was charged with defending Australia, except in the north-east, protecting the sea lanes to New Guinea, and conducting operations against Japanese shipping, airfields and other installations in the Dutch East Indies.[1]"", 'On 15 March 1945, Bostock established a forward headquarters on Morotai Island to directly control No.\xa01 TAF for the upcoming Oboe operations, the reoccupation of Borneo. Kenney gave him responsibility for all Allied air operations south of the Philippines, and the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) units which were based in the Solomon Islands to support the Bougainville Campaign were assigned to RAAF Command.[30][31] Bostock wrote to Kenney, ""I am particularly anxious that the 1st Tactical Air Force should continue to be employed as a forward offensive formation rather than in a garrison role.""[30] In April, Kenney\'s Allied Air Headquarters issued an order that Bostock would be named Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief RAAF Command, because he had several Air Officers Commanding (AOCs) reporting to him. Bostock duly passed on this change of nomenclature to his subordinate units but Air Force Headquarters in Melbourne vetoed the change in June.[32]', 'Bostock had control of the USAAF Fifth and Thirteenth Air Forces, as well as No.\xa01 TAF, during Operation Oboe One, the invasion of Tarakan, commencing 1 May 1945.[33] By this time RAAF Command comprised some 17,000 personnel.[32] On Operation Oboe Six, the invasion of Labuan–Brunei in June, Bostock also had at his disposal aircraft based in Australia under Western and North-Western Area Commands.[34] For Operation Oboe Two, the invasion of Balikpapan in July, Bostock marshalled forty Allied squadrons. His aim, in concert with that of Kenney and I\xa0Corps commander Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, was to deliver the heaviest aerial bombardment possible against enemy targets, to enable Australian assault forces to land with minimal casualties. Together with a naval barrage, this resulted in what the official history of the RAAF in World War\xa0II described as a ""scene of indescribable ruin"" on the battlefield, and allowed seventeen waves of troops to disembark their landing craft without loss.[35] MacArthur called the Labuan air offensive ""flawless"",[1] and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces, congratulated Bostock on his ""high order of control"" and ""ready and full cooperation"" throughout the Borneo campaign.[31]', 'Bostock was decorated twice in 1948 for his war service, in March with the Distinguished Service Order ""in recognition of distinguished services whilst in command of air operations in the Borneo Campaign during the period March to September, 1945"",[54] and in April with the American Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm.[20] He entered politics in 1949, standing as a Liberal Party candidate for the Federal Division of Indi in Victoria. Elected to the House of Representatives, he retained his seat until being defeated in the 1958 poll. Bostock served on a joint committee for foreign affairs and sometimes came into conflict with his own party on matters of defence policy. He continued to contribute to The Herald while in government.[1] During parliamentary debates in 1951 and again in 1957, Bostock spoke for ""an integrated defence force with a single minister"", advocating amalgamation of the four separate Departments of Defence, Air, Navy and Army into one Department of Defence, headed by the Minister for Defence. He further proposed that a single Commander-in-Chief lead the Army, Navy and Air Force; the Chief of the General Staff, the Chief of the Naval Staff, and the Chief of the Air Staff would report directly to the new position.[55][56] In 1973 the single-service departments were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing Department of Defence, and by 1984 a Chief of the Defence Force position had evolved to directly command all three armed services through their respective chiefs.[57]']"

Lacking the capital required to buy large tracts,[28] in 1818 they entered into a partnership with pirate Jean Lafitte. By then, the United States had outlawed the importation of slaves from Africa. Most Southern states gave incentives for informing on an illegal slave trader: Informers could receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction, as a reward.[citation needed]"", 'In the late 1820s, Bowie and his brother John were involved in a major Arkansas court case over land speculation.

In October he began converting to Vickers Wellington medium bombers at No.\xa027 Operational Training Unit, Lichfield, and was assigned to No.\xa0460 Squadron RAAF,[6] which formed at RAF Molesworth the following month.[7]', 'No.\xa0460 Squadron participated in 1,000-bomber raids against Cologne, Essen and Bremen in May and June 1942.[9] Brill was promoted to acting flight lieutenant in July, and completed his first tour of operations, numbering 31 sorties, on 11\xa0August.[15][16] He was seconded to the RAF as an instructor in November 1942, returning to No.\xa027 Operational Training Unit at Lichfield.[1][16] He spent the next eleven months there, leading a training flight and gaining promotion to acting squadron leader in April 1943.[15][16] In August, he was best man at the wedding of his friend and fellow RAAF pilot, Arthur Doubleday. The press would come to refer to the pair as the ""Flying Twins"", as their wartime careers closely paralleled one another—both men came from the Riverina district, joined the Air Force together on Remembrance Day 1940, arrived in England in August 1941, flew Wellingtons in No.\xa0460 Squadron, volunteered for second tours in Bomber Command, and received many decorations and promotions in tandem.[16][17] Doubleday would go on to survive the war and become active in civil aviation.[18]', ""Brill remained in the Air Force following the end of hostilities.[1] From February 1946 to August 1947 he served as the first and only commanding officer of the RAAF's newly formed and soon-disbanded Heavy Bomber Crew Conversion Unit at RAAF Station East Sale, Victoria. Little support or direction on its use as a training facility was forthcoming from higher command, and in the summer months its Avro Lincoln bombers were employed in bushfire patrols over East Gippsland, reporting 44 outbreaks in February 1947 alone.[37] Brill transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force in 1948,[1] and reverted to the rank of squadron leader. In March 1949 he became the inaugural commanding officer of a re-formed No.\xa010 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron, which had been disbanded in 1945 after service throughout World War\xa0II. In its new guise the squadron was established from the staff and facilities of RAAF Station Garbutt in Townsville. Brill's main tasks were organising to absorb or close surplus wartime facilities in North Queensland and preparing No.\xa010 Squadron for search-and-rescue operations. The unit took delivery of its first four Lincoln Mk 30s in September 1949, and Brill handed over command the following January.[38]""]"

He was to take command of all forces in Upper Canada in 1810. During this time Brock continued to ask for a posting in Europe. In June 1811 he was promoted to major general and in October of that year Lieutenant Governor Francis Gore left for England. Brock was sent to Upper Canada as senior officer commander of the troops and senior member of the [executive] council, putting him fully in charge of both the military and civil authority. He was usually referred to as president of the council or administrator of Upper Canada (never as lieutenant governor). When permission to leave for Europe finally came in early 1812, Brock declined the offer, believing he had a duty to defend Canada in war against the United States.[4][26]', ""Brock felt he needed to go further. He was hampered by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost's orders from the government, and his own inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept the bulk of his forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock also believed that he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among the legislature and other officials."", ""As for Governor General Prevost, who often clashed with Brock, he remained in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle was intended to be a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost.[65] Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.""]"

After initially being known for his lack of technique, Brooks quickly rose through the youth ranks. Brooks made his debut at the Australian Championships in 1976, but it was not until 1979 that he medalled at national level and made his debut for Australia at a FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) Swimming World Cup meet. In 1980, he gained prominence by breaking the Australian record in the 100\xa0m freestyle and being invited to a national team camp. There he had his first clash with officialdom, walking out after accusing the officials of neglecting him. He then qualified for the Australian team for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, defying political pressure to boycott the Games in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Arriving in Moscow, Brooks' experience in the 100\xa0m freestyle was an unpleasant one, suffering an asthma attack and missing the final. The peak of his swimming career came in the 4\xa0×\xa0100\xa0m medley relay, when he caught and passed the Soviet Union's Sergey Kopliakov during the anchor leg to seal a narrow victory for Australia. This victory remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at Olympic level."", 'Following the Olympics, Brooks was expelled from the Australian Institute of Sport by Don Talbot for disciplinary reasons. He accepted a swimming scholarship at the University of Arkansas, where he enjoyed the more liberal disciplinary standards. He returned to Australia for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane and again raised the ire of officials during a preparatory training camp. After lobbying for improved accommodation conditions, Brooks was involved in a physical altercation with the team manager. As a result, he was given a suspension that was to take effect after the Commonwealth Games. However, his teammates protested and threatened to walk out, resulting in the ban being rescinded. Despite the turbulent preparation, Brooks had a successful meet, winning the 100\xa0m freestyle and anchoring the 4\xa0×\xa0100\xa0m freestyle and medley relays to gold medals. Brooks competed at his second Olympics in Los Angeles in 1984 Games, where he won silver in the 4\xa0×\xa0100\xa0m freestyle relay and bronze for swimming the heats of the medley relay.', ""Kerry led off in a faster time than he had clocked in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87\xa0s. This left Australia in fourth place at the end of the first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01\xa0s, leaving the team almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94\xa0s, almost two seconds faster than his previous best.[9] He did so with an uneven arm technique due to the disparity in the strength of his arms.[13] He began to lose ground in the last 50\xa0m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg. Brooks then made a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. At the halfway mark, he had drawn level and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler Kopliakov pulled level at the 25\xa0m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22\xa0s.[9] He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him.[3] The Australian freestyler had finished his leg in 49.86\xa0s as he had vowed to his team mates.[14] The time of 3\xa0m 45.70\xa0s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women.[7][9][15] Brooks dedicated the team's win to his mother, who had died from cancer the previous Christmas.[3] Upon returning to Australia, he was greeted as a hero, but he considered retiring due to waning desire for success after his triumph in Moscow.[3] In 2000, Brooks and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.[16]"", 'Brooks suffered from a lack of motivation after the Olympics. He was recruited to the Australian Institute of Sport by swimming coaches Bill Sweetenham and Dennis Pursley, but his stay was brief. The inaugural director Don Talbot, a former head coach of the Australian swimming team, expelled him for indiscipline.[18] He then won the 1981 Australian title in the 100\xa0m freestyle without training, but his time of 52.61\xa0s was substantially slower than his personal best. Brooks then accepted a scholarship to go to the University of Arkansas to train under Sam Freas. He enjoyed the more liberal culture in the American collegiate system, particularly the relationship between swimmers and their coaches. He enjoyed the less paternalistic treatment that the coaches accorded to their swimmers, saying that ""In Australia, after a race they want to lock you in your room. In America, you can share a beer after the meet with the coach.""[3] The shortcourse pools used in the United States played into the hands of Brooks, as his strong legs gave him an advantage in pushing away from the turns, which came twice as often in comparison to longcourse (50\xa0m) pools. He had initially planned to stay in the United States for only a year, but decided to extend his stay by a year, having enjoyed the high frequency of racing and the recognition accorded to university athletes in the United States. In both years, he won the 50\xa0m and 100\xa0m freestyle double in the Southwest Conference, and was fourth in the 100\xa0m freestyle at the 1981 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships. He also came second in the 100\xa0m freestyle at the AACC Championships to Rowdy Gaines.[3]', ""Brooks then won gold as part of the winning 4\xa0×\xa0100\xa0m freestyle relay, anchoring the team of Fasala, Delany and Graeme Brewer to a victory by almost three seconds, putting in a split of 50.56\xa0s. The shaven-headed quartet was dubbed the Mean Machine.[20] He collected another gold in the medley relay, combining with David Orbell, Evans and Jon Sieben, this time completing his freestyle anchor leg in 50.44\xa0s.[20] Canada had finished the race far ahead of the Australians, but were disqualified for an early changeover.[13] After the games, Brooks completed the American college season before returning to Australia. He was named as Western Australia's Sportsman of the Year.[20]"", ""On the return flight from the games, Brooks consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television interview.[19] In his memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time.[18] In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport.[18] Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.[18]""]"

With loaned money, he moved to the United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1902.[15] He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including as a member of the Cambridge rowing crew that won the Boat Race in 1904.[16] Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the Henley Royal Regatta) and write on the subject for much of his life.[17] Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered.[18] During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in the London with the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co.[19] His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and Colombia in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.[20]"", 'Although it had been the agreement before the war that Ernest would stay and manage Paterson, Laing and Bruce while his brothers were serving, Ernest Bruce decided to enlist in the British Army in 1915. Hence, in September 1916 Bruce sought to resign his commission and return to Australia to resume management of the family business.[34] The War Office refused his request but granted him leave to return to Australia while recuperating from his injuries. As a decorated soldier on crutches with a gift for public speaking, he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in Australia. His success and popularity in this role brought the attention of the Nationalist League and then Prime Minister Billy Hughes,[35] who lobbied the British government on his behalf and succeeded in convincing the War Office to allow Bruce to relinquish his commission in June 1917.[36]', ""Bruce's popularity as a speaker for government recruitment efforts also earned him the attention of the National Union of Victoria, an influential group of Melbourne businessmen who provided much of the financing for the federal Nationalist Party.[37] As Sir William Irvine had recently resigned from parliament to become Chief Justice of Victoria, there was to be a by-election for the Division of Flinders in 1918, which the National Union asked Bruce to stand for.[37] The Nationalist preselection for the seat attracted many candidates, and Sir Edward Mitchell, one of Australia's leading constitutional lawyers, was presumed to be the front runner. Mitchell proved to be a disappointing speaker, and Bruce won preselection with the help of the National Union. A deal arranged by acting Prime Minister William Watt prevented the newly formed Country Party from challenging Bruce in what was a partly rural seat, stretching from Dandenong out into the rural areas south and east of Melbourne. In the by-election of 11 May, Bruce easily defeated his Labor opponent Gordon Holmes.[38]"", ""Bruce's early years in parliament were unremarkable and his energies were primarily focused on the affairs of Paterson, Laing and Bruce. However, in 1921 he attracted the attention of his parliamentary colleagues over the matter of the Commonwealth Line. Nationalist Prime Minister Billy Hughes, now a peace-time leader, had declined in popularity within the party due to his left-wing domestic policies.[40] The Commonwealth Line had been created by the Hughes government as a state-owned concern to ship Australian goods during World War I when British and domestic commercial shipping were unavailable. However its post-war existence was extensively criticised by Bruce as inappropriate and inefficient, and many of his economically conservative colleagues agreed.[41] Bruce also distinguished himself as one of Australia's two representatives to the League of Nations in 1921 in Geneva, at which he passionately advocated for disarmament and greater international co-operation, despite his general scepticism with regards to the League's mission and potential for success.[42]"", ""Returning from Europe in October 1921, he was invited by Prime Minister Billy Hughes to join his government as Minister for Trade and Customs. Bruce was not interested\xa0–  he was the head of one of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious conflict of interest with the portfolio, as well as being very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of Treasurer was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to Walter Massy-Greene. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy-Greene was to remain the number two in the government and Minister for Defence.[43] Bruce had only been in parliament for three years, yet his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business figures of the party. These figures had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy.[44] Influential party figures such as Senator George Pearce and the National Union had also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.[45]"", 'Bruce moved quickly to secure a working majority for his government. He convinced Hughes\' long time political ally George Pearce to join his ministry and shored up the support of the other former National Labor members of the Nationalist Party whom had walked out of the Labor Party with Hughes in 1916. He appointed William Watt as Speaker of the House, effectively removing one of his key opponents from the benches, a tactical manoeuvre that became common in Australian politics thereafter.[56] But his most lasting political achievement was the negotiation of what became known as the Coalition\xa0–  an arrangement of electoral and political co-operation between the Nationalists (and their successors) and the Country Party. Although differing greatly in character and background, the orderly and diplomatic Bruce forged a strong working relationship with the intelligent but irascible Country Party leader Page.[57] Bruce had to pay a very high price for this relationship, however.  As part of the Coalition agreement, the Country Party received five seats in a Cabinet of 11.  Page also became Treasurer and ranked second in the Cabinet.[58] The Nationalists also made major concessions on rural development and taxation policy\xa0–  compromises that stirred some resentment among some members of Bruce\'s party.[59][60]  Page, who would serve as Treasurer and de facto Deputy Prime Minister throughout Bruce\'s tenure, would become a great admirer of Bruce, stating, ""He was a leader who impressed his colleagues with his sincerity and his capacity, and earned their loyalty as the reward for his wisdom and integrity.""[61]', 'Bruce moved quickly to secure a working majority for his government.

Bruce recognised the empire had reached a turning point, but despite his optimism for a reinvigorated imperial system, there was little interest from other governments.[107] His plan for greater economic and defensive co-operation was discussed, as well as a revival of imperial preference in trading arrangements, but such ideas were now politically unpalatable in Britain and failed to develop.[109] His attitudes were almost the opposite of those held by the leaders of Canada, South Africa and the Irish Free State. As Prime Minister Baldwin remarked at the conference, ""If you, Mr Bruce, would use the word \'Empire\' a bit less and you Mr McGilligan would use it a bit more, then we would make better progress.""[110] Ultimately proposals for greater independence won out, and 1926 Imperial Conference recognised through the Balfour Declaration that dominions were essentially independent entities that freely associated as the British Commonwealth of Nations, though after much negotiation it stopped short of using the terms nation or state. Governors-General were redefined as representatives only of the British monarch, not the British government, and were obliged now to act only on the advice of their respective dominion governments. These changes were both symbolically and practically significant in the transformation of the dominions from colonies to independent nations.[111] Bruce had mixed feelings about these developments; on the one hand he believed that the Empire was still a strong and vital international organisation playing a positive role in international affairs, but on the other hand he was disappointed that other member nations did not share his vision or commitment to maintaining its integrity and unity.[81] Bruce did have some successes at the conference, however, expanding the work of the Imperial Economic Committee and increasing inter-empire co-operation in technical and scientific areas.[112]', 'Bruce\'s attitudes towards industrial relations were varied, and he was initially unsympathetic to either employer or employee complaints, believing the best resolutions to be those brokered between businesses and their employees. He frequently called upon both sides to embrace a spirit of co-operation.[20] The situation became acute when waterfront workers led by the Seamen\'s Union went on strike in 1925. This had severe and immediate effect on the Australian economy, reliant as it was on sea transportation for its imports and exports, a situation the Prime Minister recognised as untenable.[116] With the union disregarding Commonwealth rulings on the dispute, Bruce rushed through the Navigation Act and the Immigration Act. The first allowed British and foreign shipping not working under Australian industrial awards to operate in Australian waters (although British vessels working in Australia would soon initiate a strike of their own). The second allowed the Commonwealth to deport any foreign-born person whom a special tribunal found guilty of ""disrupting the industrial life of the community"".[117][118]  Key foreign-born strike leaders were immediately targeted for deportation, but New South Wales Premier Jack Lang refused to allow state police to serve summonses on two leading union leaders. Bruce responded with the Peace Officers Act, which re-established a Commonwealth police force.[119]', 'These heavy-handed tactics drew outrage from the Labor Party, which challenged the Prime Minister to seek approval from the people. This Bruce did, and the elections of 1925 were Australia\'s first ""red scare"" election.[120] He campaigned for industrial peace and an increased Commonwealth role in securing it, but also denounced ""foreign agitators"" and ""class war"" in appealing for law and order on the waterfront.[20] He openly challenged pre-existing federal arrangements, stating on the campaign trail that Australia ""should now consider whether that great historic instrument, the Constitution, meets the needs of to-day in the light of the developments which have taken place"".[121] The campaign was a success and the Bruce government was easily re-elected, increasing by 11 seats its majority over a disheartened ALP, whose leader Matthew Charlton was in poor health.', ""Furthermore, the Prime Minister's own party was breaking down underneath him. There had been no official party platform yet agreed to, and individual members had a wide degree of latitude to determine the issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections on legislation.[135] The government's existing nine-seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, as a result of by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him. Hughes and Edward Mann were two of the government's most ardent opponents in 1929.[136]"", 'Bruce and the conservatives in parliament became increasingly convinced that ""economic deterioration [was] the product, rather than the possible cause, of worsening industrial relations.""[139] Exasperated, the Prime Minister made a dramatic move and presented an ultimatum to the Australian state governments: either they should voluntarily hand their powers of industrial regulation to the federal government, or the federal government would divest itself of its industrial powers and dismantle federal arbitration.[140] The announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics, not least the members of Bruce\'s own cabinet, most of whom had not been informed of the dramatic change in policy until the day it was announced to the states.[141] Bruce calculated that the states would not give up their powers, and thus the move was one designed to sanction the end of Commonwealth arbitration. For Bruce, the only inconceivable outcome now was that the status quo of dual jurisdiction remained unchanged.[142] The opposition to the proposal, which the Prime Minister introduced to the parliament as the Maritime Industries Bill, was swift and fierce. In 1929 over 150 unions and 700,000 workers were covered by Commonwealth awards over a wide range of industries\xa0–  although there was dissatisfaction in the coal and timber sectors, most were happy with their arrangements and feared worse pay and conditions if moved back to state awards.[143] He defended his actions as being necessary to create certainty and end the duplication that had caused so many problems in recent years.[144]', 'A snap election was called, with Bruce taking his case to the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed.[130] Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.[134]', ""Bruce returned to England after his defeat to holiday and attend to his business.  Sir John Latham, took over as leader of the Nationalists. With the stock market crash in 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression in Australia, Bruce commented to his colleagues that their defeat was probably fortunate.[151] But he ardently defended his government's record, maintaining that the economic crisis was inevitable and that his own policies were justified attempts to try to strengthen the Australian economy.[152] It was this defence that he mounted in April 1931 when he announced he would return to politics and seek to regain his seat of Flinders at the next election. By now the Nationalists had regrouped as the United Australia Party (UAP) under Joseph Lyons, who had defected with several others from the embattled Scullin government.[153]"", ""After the success of the Imperial Economic Conference, Lyons appointed Bruce to London as Resident Minister in the United Kingdom\xa0–  it was to remain his and Ethel's home for the rest of their lives.[160] His first task in London was to renegotiate the terms of Australia's burgeoning government debts, the repayment of which was crippling Depression-era Australia.[161] Over two years, he negotiated with the Westminster Bank and the British Government for loan conversions worth £84\xa0million, which saved Australia millions of pounds in interest over several years and along with the Ottawa Agreements were significant in helping alleviate the Australian government's budgetary difficulties.[162] Bruce was asked at several points during the 1930s to return to Australia by UAP backers and other political figures, who hoped that he could replace Lyons as prime minister. He himself had questioned Lyons' health and capacity to execute the role effectively, but he showed little interest in returning.[163][164] In 1938 and 1939 Bruce was approached by senior UAP figures and Lyons himself to return to Australia and assume the leadership of the government, which was struggling under the ailing Lyons, but he either flatly declined or set conditions for his return (such as an all-party government behind him) that were impossible to meet.[165]"", ""In September 1933, Bruce was appointed by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933.[166] Bruce would excel in the new post, becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a familiar face in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally.[167] Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for Edward VIII's abdication in 1936.[168] His importance and power in London was due in part to the free rein that Lyons gave him\xa0–  a rarity in the history of the position.[169] Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, Bruce was generally credited as Australia's most influential and credible international representative during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.[170]"", ""In September 1933, Bruce was appointed by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank.

He opposed action against Japan following the invasion of Manchuria in 1933, concerned as to Australia\'s trading relationship with Japan and the potential future threat it posed to peace in the Pacific.[171]  He also attempted to steer the League away from sanctioning member nations, believing it yet lacked the military or economic sway to do so effectively and feared the breakdown of the League\xa0–  a prospect that loomed after Germany and Japan departed the body in 1933.[172] During the Abyssinia Crisis, Bruce again counselled against partial sanctions, believing them the worst option as they would not stop the Ethiopian invasion and yet would alienate Italy\xa0–  then a potential ally against a rearming Nazi Germany.[172] He further argued for much greater rearmament efforts in the United Kingdom and France to provide greater military capacity to enforce future decisions by the League. Bruce assumed the presidency of the League of Nations Council in 1936 at the height of the crisis and after the failure of the Hoare–Laval Pact between France, Italy and Britain, but further attempts to forestall the invasion failed. He presided as League Council President during the Rhineland Crisis, although once again attempts to respond to fascist aggression failed. Although this did not shake his conviction in the potential of the League, he saw it doomed to failure without fundamental reforms to its structure and system of sanctions.[173] He was nominated by Turkey to chair the 1936 Montreux Conference, which was far more successful in negotiating international agreement on passage through the Turkish Straits\xa0–  an issue of particular relevance to Bruce as a veteran of the Gallipoli campaign.[174] Despite the turmoil of his presidency, the League historian F.P. Walters would later describe Bruce as ""the best, perhaps, of the many first-rate chairmen who presided over the Council, Conferences, or Committees of the League"".[175]', ""The plan was supported by Secretary-General Joseph Louis Anne Avenol, who like Bruce recognised that the League was rapidly becoming moribund and that a major change of direction was needed, although neither was successful in convincing key states in contributing to the plan.[180][181] Critically, new British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain could not be convinced by Bruce to invest further into the development of the League, and the body began to lose its political impetus as war loomed. He would continue to press for League reform in the lead up to the war. The Bruce committee to advise on League reform was formed in 1939 in the aftermath of the partition of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany and the apparent failure of Chamberlain's appeasement policy. This committee, which met in July and August 1939, proposed a significant expansion of Bruce's earlier ideas to the League, bringing a wide range of economic and social programs under its purview as a means of fostering international co-operation. Their work, however, would be rendered moot by the outbreak of World War II.[182]"", ""Britain's declaration of war against Germany on 3 September 1939 was followed within hours by Australia's Prime Minister Menzies stating that because of Britain's declaration Australia too was now at war with Germany. Winston Churchill's accession as British Prime Minister in May 1940 brought Bruce into frequent conflict with the British government. Churchill saw the dominions as still semi-dependent colonies who were at London's command[188] whereas Bruce saw the Empire as a kind of international partnership and the dominions as rightful parties to the decision-making process.[189] Britain's preoccupation with the European theatre alarmed Australian politicians, given the tenuous position of Far Eastern possessions and the looming possibility of Japanese invasion.[190]"", ""By the war's end in 1945, Bruce had become tired of the High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's successor Ben Chifley that he would not object to being replaced in the position.[197] In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers\xa0–  the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and China\xa0–  that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters.[198] Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international co-operation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations.[199] The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work came to the attention of Eleanor Roosevelt, and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that Franklin Roosevelt convened in Hot Springs, Virginia, in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.[200]"", 'As the war in Europe drew to a close and the United Nations Charter was promulgated in June 1945, Bruce\'s name was among those being considered to become the first Secretary-General of the United Nations, with American Secretary of State Dean Acheson and British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden actively supporting his candidacy.[201] Bruce, however, was now 62 and indicated that he felt himself too old for the position, instead preferring a less demanding role considering economic and social questions.[202] In 1946 he assumed the chairmanship of the FAO Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals, which had the mission of establishing a ""world food board"" to coordinate international policy on nutrition and develop a system to eliminate global agricultural shortages.[203] He proposed many international schemes as part of this work, particularly a world food reserve and special pricing mechanisms to reallocate and release food to where it was most needed in times of need.[203] Bruce\'s Commission also placed a high emphasis on agricultural modernisation, international development aid, commodity agreements and price stability to help starving developing nations in its findings presented in 1947.[204] The proposals were never adopted, as the costs and challenges to national sovereignty proved too difficult to overcome politically.[205]', 'Undeterred, Bruce was elected Chairman of the newly formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute shortages of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations.[206] More than two-thirds of the world was undernourished in 1949[207] and Bruce felt it imperative for the council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations.[208] A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough to keep pace with the post-war population boom.[209] The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied.[210] Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.[211]', ""Bruce occupied a range of positions in his later years, sharing his time between the United Kingdom and Australia. He had been Chairman of the Finance Corporation of Industry since 1946 and continued in the role until 1957, providing finance to projects of benefit to the British national economy. Bruce helped establish the program in Australia in 1954 and on a Commonwealth basis in 1956.[213] He became the first Chancellor of the newly established Australian National University in 1952, and took an active interest in its development, especially as a research centre for the study of Asia and the Pacific.[214] Bruce concluded that Australia's position in the world had changed as a result of World War II, commenting:"", 'Despite his many accomplishments both at home and abroad, Bruce\'s post-prime ministerial career was not well known in Australia, and most still harboured memories of his harsh anti-union legislation and his government\'s landslide defeat in 1929.[224] His public persona was one of an aloof man, too English for Australia in style and bearing.[20] Upon his death in 1967, The Age of his hometown Melbourne remarked that ""for most Australians, he is little more than a shadow.""[225] Bruce spent much of his life and career in the United Kingdom, the country that conversely held him in high regard, but never forgot his Australian roots and for much of his career was a tireless advocate for its interests. In contrast to his image as a member of the British aristocratic elite, he spent much of his later career working for solutions to the problems facing the world\'s poorest.[226]', 'Bruce was high-minded and ambitious in setting an agenda\xa0–  as prime minister he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic, social and administrative development, including grandiose solutions to the problem of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of the British Empire. In his diplomatic career he pursued better treatment for the Commonwealth and programs through the League of Nations and United Nations that would address world questions of pressing social and economic concern, culminating in his most ambitious work to eliminate world hunger through the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Australian government even nominated Bruce for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition for these efforts.[227] Yet his schemes frequently bordered on the idealistic, and he was frequently disappointed at the limited degree to which he could practically implement his ideas. As Bruce himself would concede in later life, he was overly ambitious by nature and ""forever buying into things that aren\'t really my concern"".[228] But despite his lack of public recognition in Australia, peers and historians have long recognised the abiding impact Bruce had both as prime minister and internationalist, leading his successor as Chancellor of the Australian National University Sir John Cockcroft to conclude in 1962 that Bruce was ""probably the outstanding Australian of our time"".[229] The Melbourne Sun agreed with the assessment, stating upon his death that Bruce was ""probably the least remembered but the most extraordinary of our Prime Ministers"".[225]', 'Bruce was high-minded and ambitious in setting an agenda\xa0–  as prime minister he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic, social and administrative development, including grandiose solutions to the problem of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of the British Empire.

Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed.[103][104] By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.[102]', 'In January 2019, Bruce was appointed manager of Championship club Sheffield Wednesday with effect from the start of the following month.[173] On 27 January, his delay in taking up this appointment was criticised by Match of the Day pundits Danny Murphy and Ruud Gullit during a 3–0 FA Cup defeat away to Chelsea.[174] Bruce subsequently defended his decision, as he had had two operations since leaving Aston Villa and needed time to recuperate, as well as the need to recover from the death of both his parents in 2018.[175]', ""BBC Sport reported in July 2019 that Bruce had resigned from his position at Wednesday,[176] after he earlier admitted that he had held talks with Premier League Newcastle United over their managerial vacancy.[177] His appointment at Newcastle was confirmed on 17 July.[178] Sheffield Wednesday, however, soon filed a report to the Premier League alleging misconduct in his appointment,[179][180] stating that there were still outstanding legal issues with Bruce having resigned just 48 hours earlier, whilst also suspecting that confidential details of Bruce's contract were leaked making it impossible for him to remain at the club.[181] Newcastle United denied any wrongdoing and stated that they were confident no case could be escalated.[182] Reaction from the fans was mixed, with some feeling Bruce would not achieve the standard set by his predecessor Rafael Benítez, whilst his recent lack of Premier League football and management of rival club Sunderland proved controversial.[183][184] Bruce acknowledged Benítez's popularity, and stated he hoped the fans would not rush to judgement and give him time to prove himself.[185]  Bruce soon made six signings,[186] notably securing Joelinton from 1899 Hoffenheim for £40\xa0million, breaking the club's transfer fee record previously set by the purchase of Miguel Almirón for £21\xa0million six months earlier.[187][188]"", 'On 3 February 2022, Bruce was appointed manager of EFL Championship club West Bromwich Albion, replacing Valérien Ismaël.

The affray left him with facial injuries but did not prevent him from travelling to a Premier League match the same day.[203] After the incident one newspaper attempted to connect it with the allegations concerning Hendrie, leading Bruce to contemplate legal action.[202]', ""Bruce's autobiography, Heading for Victory, was published in 1994. In 1999, while manager of Huddersfield, he wrote a trio of novels: Striker!, Sweeper! and Defender!. The books centred on fictional football manager Steve Barnes, based on Bruce, who solved murder mysteries and thwarted terrorists. Bruce later expressed his embarrassment at the books, which have become sought-after collectables.[204][205]  He intended to publish a new autobiography in late 2019 but the book was postponed indefinitely due to the deaths of his parents and his desire to concentrate on his job at Newcastle.[206]""]"

He returned to his native state of Kentucky in 1857 and was appointed adjutant general by Governor Beriah Magoffin in 1861. In this position, he tried to enforce Kentucky\'s neutrality policy in the early days of the Civil War. When the state\'s neutrality was breached, Buckner accepted a commission in the Confederate Army after declining a similar commission to the Union Army. In 1862, he accepted Ulysses S. Grant\'s demand for an ""unconditional surrender"" at the Battle of Fort Donelson. He was the first Confederate general to surrender an army in the war. He spent five months as a prisoner of war. After his release, Buckner participated in Braxton Bragg\'s failed invasion of Kentucky and near the end of the war became chief of staff to Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department.', 'In the years following the war, Buckner became active in politics. He was elected governor of Kentucky in 1887, in his second campaign for that office. His term was plagued by violent feuds in the eastern part of the state, including the Hatfield–McCoy feud and the Rowan County War. His administration was rocked by scandal when state treasurer James ""Honest Dick"" Tate absconded with $250,000 from the state\'s treasury. As governor, Buckner became known for vetoing special interest legislation. In the 1888 legislative session alone, he issued more vetoes than the previous ten governors combined. In 1895, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. The following year, he joined the National Democratic Party, or ""Gold Democrats"", who favored a gold standard policy over the Free Silver position of the mainline Democrats. He was the National Democratic Party\'s candidate for Vice President of the United States in the 1896 election, but polled just over one percent of the vote on a ticket with his running mate, ex-Union general John M.

When Harold Jeffreys in Cambridge, England, offered his mathematical treatment in Operational Methods in Mathematical Physics (1927), Bush responded with his seminal textbook Operational Circuit Analysis (1929) for instructing electrical engineering students. In the preface he wrote:', 'During World War\xa0I, Bush had become aware of poor cooperation between civilian scientists and the military. Concerned about the lack of coordination in scientific research and the requirements of defense mobilization, Bush proposed the creation of a general directive agency in the federal government, which he discussed with his colleagues. He had the secretary of NACA prepare a draft of the proposed National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) to be presented to Congress, but after the Germans invaded France in May 1940, Bush decided speed was important and approached President Franklin D. Roosevelt directly. Through the President\'s uncle, Frederic Delano, Bush managed to set up a meeting with Roosevelt on June 12, 1940, to which he brought a single sheet of paper describing the agency. Roosevelt approved the proposal in 15\xa0minutes, writing ""OK – FDR"" on the sheet.[34]', 'With Bush as chairman, the NDRC was functioning even before the agency was officially established by order of the Council of National Defense on June 27, 1940. The organization operated financially on a hand-to-mouth basis with monetary support from the president\'s emergency fund.[35] Bush appointed four leading scientists to the NDRC: Karl Taylor Compton (president of MIT), James B. Conant (president of Harvard University), Frank B. Jewett (president of the National Academy of Sciences and chairman of the Board of Directors of Bell Laboratories), and Richard C. Tolman (dean of the graduate school at Caltech); Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, Sr. and Brigadier General George V. Strong represented the military. The civilians already knew each other well, which allowed the organization to begin functioning immediately.[36] The NDRC established itself in the administration building at the Carnegie Institution of Washington.[37] Each member of the committee was assigned an area of responsibility, while Bush handled coordination. A small number of projects reported to him directly, such as the S-1 Section.[38] Compton\'s deputy, Alfred Loomis, said that ""of the men whose death in the Summer of 1940 would have been the greatest calamity for America, the President is first, and Dr.\xa0Bush would be second or third.""[39]', ""Bush met with Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace on October 9, 1941, to discuss the project. He briefed Roosevelt on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee, which had concluded that an atomic bomb was feasible, and on the German nuclear energy project, about which little was known. Roosevelt approved and expedited the atomic program. To control it, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George Marshall.[69] On Bush's advice, Roosevelt chose the army to run the project rather than the navy, although the navy had shown far more interest in the field, and was already conducting research into atomic energy for powering ships. Bush's negative experiences with the Navy had convinced him that it would not listen to his advice, and could not handle large-scale construction projects.[70][71]"", 'A week later, on June 23rd, President Roosevelt sent this one-sentence memo back to Bush: ""Do you have the money?""\n[74]', 'Before the end of the Second World War, Bush and Conant had foreseen and sought to avoid a possible nuclear arms race. Bush proposed international scientific openness and information sharing as a method of self-regulation for the scientific community, to prevent any one political group gaining a scientific advantage. Before nuclear research became public knowledge, Bush used the development of biological weapons as a model for the discussion of similar issues, an ""opening wedge"". He was less successful in promoting his ideas in peacetime with President Harry Truman, than he had been under wartime conditions with Roosevelt.[86][87]', 'With Truman as president, men like John R. Steelman, who was appointed chairman of the President\'s Scientific Research Board in October 1946, came to prominence.[110] Bush\'s authority, both among scientists and politicians, suffered a rapid decline, though he remained a revered figure.[111] In September 1949, he was appointed to head a scientific panel that included Oppenheimer to review the evidence that the Soviet Union had tested its first atomic bomb. The panel concluded that it had, and this finding was relayed to Truman, who made the public announcement.[112] During 1952 Bush was one of five members of the State Department Panel of Consultants on Disarmament, and led the panel in urging that the United States postpone its planned first test of the hydrogen bomb and seek a test ban with the Soviet Union, on the grounds that avoiding a test might forestall development of a catastrophic new weapon and open the way for new arms agreements between the two nations.[113] The panel lacked political allies in Washington, however, and the Ivy Mike shot went ahead as scheduled.[113] Bush was outraged when a security hearing stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance in 1954; he issued a strident attack on Oppenheimer\'s accusers in The New York Times. Alfred Friendly summed up the feeling of many scientists in declaring that Bush had become ""the Grand Old Man of American science"".[114]']"

Born in South Carolina, he adamantly defended American slavery and sought to protect the interests of white Southerners. Calhoun began his political career as a nationalist, modernizer and proponent of a strong federal government and protective tariffs. In the late 1820s, his views changed radically, and he became a leading proponent of states' rights, limited government, nullification, and opposition to high tariffs. Calhoun saw Northern acceptance of those policies as a condition of the South's remaining in the Union. His beliefs heavily influenced the South's secession from the Union in 1860 and 1861. He was the first of two vice presidents to resign from the position, the second being Spiro Agnew, who resigned in 1973."", 'Calhoun began his political career with election to the House of Representatives in 1810. As a prominent leader of the war hawk faction, he strongly supported the War of 1812. Calhoun served as Secretary of War under President James Monroe and, in that position, reorganized and modernized the War Department. He was a candidate for the presidency in the 1824 election. After failing to gain support, Calhoun agreed to be a candidate for vice president. The Electoral College elected him vice president by an overwhelming majority. He served under John Quincy Adams and continued under Andrew Jackson, who defeated Adams in the election of 1828, making Calhoun the most recent U.S. vice president to serve under two different presidents.', ""He had a difficult relationship with Jackson, primarily because of the Nullification Crisis and the Petticoat affair. In contrast with his previous nationalist sentiments, Calhoun vigorously supported South Carolina's right to nullify federal tariff legislation that he believed unfairly favored the North, which put him into conflict with Unionists such as Jackson. In 1832, with only a few months remaining in his second term, Calhoun resigned as vice president and was elected to the Senate. He sought the Democratic Party nomination for the presidency in 1844 but lost to surprise nominee James K. Polk, who won the general election. Calhoun served as Secretary of State under President John Tyler from 1844 to 1845, and in that role supported the annexation of Texas as a means to extend the Slave Power and helped to settle the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain. Calhoun returned to the Senate, where he opposed the Mexican–American War, the Wilmot Proviso and the Compromise of 1850 before he died of tuberculosis in 1850. He often served as a virtual independent who variously aligned as needed, with Democrats and Whigs."", ""Young Calhoun showed scholastic talent, and although schools were scarce on the Carolina frontier, he was enrolled briefly in an academy taught by his brother-in-law  Moses Waddel.  It stressed the Latin and Greek classics. He continued his studies privately. When his father died, his brothers were away starting business careers, and so the 14-year-old Calhoun took over management of the family farm and five other farms. For four years he simultaneously kept up his reading and his hunting and fishing. The family decided he should continue his education, and so he resumed studies at Waddel's academy after it reopened.[9] With financing from his brothers, he went to Yale College in Connecticut in 1802. For the first time in his life, Calhoun encountered serious, advanced, and well-organized intellectual dialogue that could shape his mind. Yale was dominated by President Timothy Dwight, a Federalist who became his mentor. Dwight's brilliance entranced (and sometimes repelled) Calhoun."", 'Despite American successes, the mismanagement of the Army during the war distressed Calhoun, and he resolved to strengthen and centralize the War Department.[29] The militia had proven itself quite unreliable during the war and Calhoun saw the need for a permanent and professional military force. In 1816 he called for building an effective navy, including steam frigates, as well as a standing army of adequate size. The British blockade of the coast had underscored the necessity of rapid means of internal transportation; Calhoun proposed a system of ""great permanent roads"". The blockade had cut off the import of manufactured items, so he emphasized the need to encourage more domestic manufacture, fully realizing that industry was based in the Northeast. The dependence of the old financial system on import duties was devastated when the blockade cut off imports. Calhoun called for a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war-time shrinkage of maritime trade, as the tariffs had done. The expiration of the charter of the First Bank of the United States had also distressed the Treasury, so to reinvigorate and modernize the economy Calhoun called for a new national bank. A new bank was chartered as the Second Bank of the United States by Congress and approved by President James Madison in 1816. Through his proposals, Calhoun emphasized a national footing and downplayed sectionalism and states rights. Historian Ulrich B. Phillips says that at this stage of Calhoun\'s career, ""The word nation was often on his lips, and his conviction was to enhance national unity which he identified with national power""[30]', 'In 1817, the deplorable state of the War Department led four men to decline offers from President James Monroe to accept the office of Secretary of War before Calhoun finally assumed the role. Calhoun took office on December 8 and served until 1825.[9] He continued his role as a leading nationalist during the Era of Good Feelings. He proposed an elaborate program of national reforms to the infrastructure that he believed would speed up economic modernization. His priority was an effective navy, including steam frigates, and in the second place a standing army of adequate size—and as further preparation for an emergency, ""great permanent roads"", ""a certain encouragement"" to manufacturers, and a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war-time shrinkage of maritime trade, like customs duties.[39]', 'As secretary, Calhoun had responsibility for the management of Indian affairs. He promoted a plan, adopted by Monroe in 1825, to preserve the sovereignty of eastern Indians by relocating them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments.[41] In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes.[42] Calhoun opposed the invasion of Spanish Florida launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the First Seminole War, which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe, and in private with other cabinet members, advocated censuring of Jackson as punishment. Calhoun claimed that Jackson had begun a war against Spain in violation of the Constitution and, that he had contradicted Calhoun\'s explicit orders in doing so. Specific official instructions not to invade Florida or attack the Spanish were not issued by the administration.[43] However, Calhoun supported the execution of Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert Ambrister, two British soldiers living in Florida who were accused of inciting the Seminole to make war against the United States. Calhoun accused the British of being involved in ""wickedness, corruption, and barbarity at which the heart sickens and which in this enlightened age it ought not scarcely to be believed that a Christian nation would have participated"". He added that he hoped the executions of Arbuthnot and Ambrister would deter the British and any other nations ""who by false promises delude and excite an Indian tribe to all the deeds of savage war"".[44] The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the Adams–Onís Treaty.[9]', 'Calhoun was initially a candidate for President of the United States in the election of 1824. Four other men also sought the presidency: Andrew Jackson, Adams, Crawford, and Henry Clay. Calhoun failed to win the endorsement of the South Carolina legislature, and his supporters in Pennsylvania decided to abandon his candidacy in favor of Jackson\'s, and instead supported him for vice president. Other states soon followed, and Calhoun therefore allowed himself to become a candidate for vice president rather than president.[9][47] The Electoral College elected Calhoun vice president by a landslide on December 1, 1824. He won 182 of 261 electoral votes, while five other men received the remaining votes.[48] No presidential candidate received a majority in the Electoral College, and the election was ultimately resolved by the House of Representatives, where Adams was declared the winner over Crawford and Jackson, who in the election had led Adams in both popular vote and electoral vote. After Clay, the Speaker of the House, was appointed Secretary of State by Adams, Jackson\'s supporters denounced what they considered a ""corrupt bargain"" between Adams and Clay to give Adams the presidency in exchange for Clay receiving the office of Secretary of State, the holder of which had traditionally become the next president. Calhoun also expressed some concerns, which caused friction between him and Adams.[49]', 'Calhoun also opposed President Adams\' plan to send a delegation to observe a meeting of South and Central American leaders in Panama, believing that the United States should stay out of foreign affairs. Calhoun became disillusioned with Adams\' high tariff policies and increased centralization of government through a network of ""internal improvements"", which he now saw as a threat to the rights of the states. Calhoun wrote to Jackson on June 4, 1826, informing him that he would support Jackson\'s second campaign for the presidency in 1828. The two were never particularly close friends. Calhoun never fully trusted Jackson, a frontiersman and popular war hero, but hoped that his election would bring some reprieve from Adams\'s anti-states\' rights policies.[9] Jackson selected Calhoun as his running mate, and together they defeated Adams and his running mate Richard Rush.[50] Calhoun thus became the second of two vice presidents to serve under two different presidents. The only other man who accomplished this feat was George Clinton, who served as vice president from 1805 to 1812 under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.[51]', 'In 1830, reports had emerged accurately stating that Calhoun, as Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These infuriated Jackson.[60] Eventually, Lewis decided to reveal the existence of Forsyth\'s letter, and on April 30, Crawford wrote a second letter, this time to Forsyth, repeating the charge Forsyth represented him as having previously made. Jackson received the letter on May 12, which confirmed his suspicions. He claimed that Calhoun had ""betrayed"" him.[61] Eaton took his revenge on Calhoun. For reasons unclear, Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson about the possibility of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson at the time of the Seminole War. Eaton did nothing, leading Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters.[62] Calhoun published them in the United States Telegraph, a newspaper edited by a Calhoun protégé, Duff Green.[9] This gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy to damage him and further enraged the President.[62]', 'Finally in the spring of 1831, at the suggestion of Van Buren, who, like Jackson, supported the Eatons, Jackson replaced all but one of his Cabinet members, thereby limiting Calhoun\'s influence. Van Buren began the process by resigning as Secretary of State, facilitating Jackson\'s removal of others. Van Buren thereby grew in favor with Jackson, while the rift between the President and Calhoun was widened.[63] Later, in 1832, Calhoun, as vice president, cast a tie-breaking vote against Jackson\'s nomination of Van Buren as Minister to Great Britain in a failed attempt to end Van Buren\'s political career. Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, a staunch supporter of Jackson, then stated that Calhoun had ""elected a Vice President"", as Van Buren was able to move past his failed nomination as Minister to Great Britain and instead gain the Democratic Party\'s vice-presidential nomination in the 1832 election, in which he and Jackson were victorious.[9]', 'Calhoun had begun to oppose increases in protective tariffs, as they generally benefited Northerners more than Southerners. While he was vice president in the Adams administration, Jackson\'s supporters devised a high tariff legislation that placed duties on imports that were also made in New England. Calhoun had been assured that the northeastern interests would reject the Tariff of 1828, exposing pro-Adams New England congressmen to charges that they selfishly opposed legislation popular among Jacksonian Democrats in the west and mid-Atlantic States. The Southern legislators miscalculated and the so-called ""Tariff of Abominations"" passed and was signed into law by President Adams. Frustrated, Calhoun returned to his South Carolina plantation, where he anonymously composed South Carolina Exposition and Protest, an essay rejecting the centralization philosophy and supporting the principle of nullification as a means to prevent a tyranny of a central government.[64]', 'In ""South Carolina Exposition and Protest"", Calhoun argued that a state could veto any federal law that went beyond the enumerated powers and encroached upon the residual powers of the State.[68] President Jackson, meanwhile, generally supported states\' rights, but opposed nullification and secession. At the 1830 Jefferson Day dinner at Jesse Brown\'s Indian Queen Hotel, Jackson proposed a toast and proclaimed, ""Our federal Union, it must be preserved.""[69] Calhoun replied, ""The Union, next to our liberty, the most dear. May we all remember that it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the states, and distributing equally the benefit and burden of the Union.""[70] Calhoun\'s publication of letters from the Seminole War in the Telegraph caused his relationship with Jackson to deteriorate further, thus contributing to the nullification crisis. Jackson and Calhoun began an angry correspondence that lasted until Jackson stopped it in July.[9]', ""Jackson supported a revision to tariff rates known as the Tariff of 1832. It was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates. Written by Treasury Secretary Louis McLane, the bill lowered duties from 45% to 27%. In May, Representative John Quincy Adams introduced a slightly revised version of the bill, which Jackson accepted. It passed Congress on July 9 and was signed by the president on July 14. The bill failed to satisfy extremists on either side.[71] In October, the South Carolina legislature voted to call a convention to nullify the tariffs.[72] On November 24, the South Carolina Nullification Convention passed an ordinance nullifying both the Tariff of 1832 and the Tariff of 1828 and threatening to secede if the federal government attempted to enforce the tariffs.[73][74] In response, Jackson sent U.S. Navy warships to Charleston harbor, and threatened to hang Calhoun or any man who worked to support nullification or secession.[75] After joining the Senate, Calhoun began to work with Clay on a new compromise tariff. A bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by Representative Gulian C. Verplanck of New York, but it lowered rates more sharply than Clay and other protectionists desired. Clay managed to get Calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for Clay's opposition to Jackson's military threats and, perhaps, with the hope that he could win some Southern votes in his next bid for the presidency.[76] On the same day, Congress passed the Force Bill, which empowered the President of the United States to use military force to ensure state compliance with federal law. South Carolina accepted the tariff, but in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill.[77] In Calhoun's speech against the Force Bill, delivered on February 5, 1833, no longer as vice president, he strongly endorsed nullification, at one point saying:"", 'Why, then, confer on the President the extensive and unlimited powers provided in this bill? Why authorize him to use military force to arrest the civil process of the State? But one answer can be given: That, in a contest between the State and the General Government, if the resistance be limited on both sides to the civil process, the State, by its inherent sovereignty, standing upon its reserved powers, will prove too powerful in such a controversy, and must triumph over the Federal Government, sustained by its delegated and limited authority; and in this answer we have an acknowledgment of the truth of those great principles for which the State has so firmly and nobly contended.[78]', 'When Harrison died in 1841 after a month in office, Vice President John Tyler succeeded him. Tyler, a former Democrat, was expelled from the Whig Party after vetoing bills passed by the Whig congressional majority to reestablish a national bank and raise tariffs.[93] He named Calhoun Secretary of State on April 10, 1844, following the death of Abel P. Upshur, one of six people killed when a cannon exploded during a public demonstration in the USS Princeton disaster.', ""In advance of Calhoun's arrival in Washington, D.C., Tyler attempted to quickly finalize the treaty negotiations. Sam Houston, President of the Texas Republic, fearing Mexican retaliation, insisted on a tangible demonstration of U.S. commitments to the security of Texas. When key Texas diplomats failed to appear on schedule, the delay compelled Tyler to bring his new Secretary of State directly into negotiations.[102] Secretary Calhoun was directed to honor former Secretary Upshur's verbal assurances of protection[104] now offered by Calhoun in writing, to provide for U.S. military intervention in the event that Mexico used force to hold Texas. Tyler deployed U.S. Navy vessels to the Gulf of Mexico and ordered army units mobilized, entirely paid for with $100,000 of executive branch contingency funds. The move side-stepped constitutional requirements that Congress authorize appropriations for war.[102]"", ""In the general election, Calhoun offered his endorsement to Polk on condition that he support the annexation of Texas, oppose the Tariff of 1842, and dissolve the Washington Globe, the semi-official propaganda organ of the Democratic Party headed by Francis Preston Blair. He received these assurances and enthusiastically supported Polk's candidacy.[113] Polk narrowly defeated Henry Clay, who opposed annexation.[114] Lame-duck President Tyler organized a joint House–Senate vote on the Texas treaty which passed, requiring only a simple majority. He signed a bill of annexation on March 1, With President Polk's support, the Texas annexation treaty was approved by the Texas Republic in 1845.[115] A bill to admit Texas as the 28th state of the Union was signed by Polk on December 29, 1845.[116]"", 'A major crisis emerged from the persistent Oregon boundary dispute between Great Britain and the United States, due to an increasing number of American migrants. The territory included most of present-day British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. American expansionists used the slogan ""54–40 or fight"" in reference to the Northern boundary coordinates of the Oregon territory. The parties compromised, ending the war threat, by splitting the area down the middle at the 49th parallel, with the British acquiring British Columbia and the Americans accepting Washington and Oregon. Calhoun, along with President Polk and Secretary of State James Buchanan, continued work on the treaty while he was a senator, and it was ratified by a vote of 41–14 on June 18, 1846.[121]', 'In 1910, the state of South Carolina gave a statue of Calhoun to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol.[171] Also in the Capitol, there is an 1896 bust of Calhoun in the U.S. Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection, and he is one of the ""Famous Five"" former members originally selected by the Senate in 1957 to be honored with a portrait in Senate Reception Room.[172][173]', 'In response to decades of requests, Yale President Peter Salovey announced in 2017 that the university\'s Calhoun College would be renamed to honor Grace Hopper, a pioneering computer programmer, mathematician and Navy rear admiral who graduated from Yale.[190] Calhoun is commemorated elsewhere on the campus, including the exterior of Harkness Tower, a prominent campus landmark, as one of Yale\'s ""Eight Worthies"".[191]']"

He was a focus for the opposition, like his father before him, and Caroline's relationship with him was strained. As princess and as queen, Caroline was known for her political influence, which she exercised both through and for Walpole. Her tenure included four regencies, which occurred during George II's stays in Hanover; she is credited with strengthening the House of Hanover's place in Britain during a period of political instability. After her death in 1737, Caroline was widely mourned by her political allies as well as by the King, who refused to remarry."", ""Two years after their arrival in England, Caroline suffered a stillbirth, which her friend the Countess of Bückeburg blamed on the incompetence of English doctors,[32] but the following year she had another son, Prince George William, in November. At the baptism, George Augustus fell out with his father over the choice of godparents, leading to the couple's placement under house arrest at St James's Palace prior to their banishment from court.[33] Caroline was originally allowed to stay with their children, but refused as she believed her place was with George Augustus.[34] The couple moved into Leicester House, while their children remained in the care of the King.[35] Caroline fell sick with worry, and fainted during a secret visit to her children made without the King's approval.[36] By January, the King had relented and allowed Caroline unrestricted access. In February, Prince George William fell ill, and the King allowed both George Augustus and Caroline to see him at Kensington Palace without any conditions. When the baby died, a post-mortem was conducted to prove that the cause of death was disease (a polyp on the heart) rather than the separation from his mother.[37] Further tragedy occurred in 1718, when she miscarried at Richmond Lodge, her country residence,[38] after being startled by a violent storm.[39] Over the next few years, Caroline had three more children: William, Mary and Louise.[40] In July 1725, her 11th and final pregnancy ended in a second miscarriage.[41]"", ""Leicester House became a frequent meeting place for the ministry's political opponents. Caroline struck up a friendship with politician Sir Robert Walpole, a former minister in the Whig government who led a disgruntled faction of the party. In April 1720, Walpole's wing of the Whig party reconciled with the governing wing, and Walpole and Caroline helped to effect a reconciliation between the King and George Augustus for the sake of public unity.[2][42] Caroline wanted to regain her three eldest daughters, who remained in the care of the King, and thought the reconciliation would lead to their return, but negotiations came to nothing. George Augustus came to believe that Walpole had tricked him into the reconciliation as part of a scheme to gain power. The prince was isolated politically when Walpole's Whigs joined the government,[43] and Leicester House played host to literary figures and wits, such as John Arbuthnot and Jonathan Swift, rather than politicians.[44] Arbuthnot told Swift that Caroline had enjoyed his Gulliver's Travels, particularly the tale of the crown prince who wore one high-heel and one low-heel in a country where the King and his party wore low heels, and the opposition wore high ones: a barely veiled reference to the political leanings of the Prince of Wales.[45]"", 'Caroline\'s intellect far outstripped her husband\'s, and she read avidly. She established an extensive library at St James\'s Palace. As a young woman, she corresponded with Gottfried Leibniz, the intellectual colossus who was courtier and factotum to the House of Hanover. She later facilitated the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence, arguably the most important philosophy of physics discussion of the 18th century. She helped to popularise the practice of variolation (an early type of immunisation), which had been witnessed by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Charles Maitland in Constantinople. At the direction of Caroline, six condemned prisoners from Newgate Prison[46] were offered the chance to undergo variolation instead of execution: they all survived, as did six orphan children given the same treatment as a further test. Convinced of its medical value, Caroline had her children Amelia, Caroline and Frederick inoculated against smallpox in the same manner.[47] In praising her support for smallpox inoculation, Voltaire wrote of her, ""I must say that despite all her titles and crowns, this princess was born to encourage the arts and the well-being of mankind; even on the throne she is a benevolent philosopher; and she has never lost an opportunity to learn or to manifest her generosity.""[48]', 'On George I\'s death in 1727, George Augustus ascended as George II and Caroline became queen consort. George II and Caroline\'s coronation was held at Westminster Abbey on 11 October that year.[49] Though George II denounced Walpole as a ""rogue and rascal"" over the terms of the reconciliation with his father, Caroline advised her husband to retain Walpole as the leading minister.[2] Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II had little choice but to accept him or risk ministerial instability.[50] Walpole secured a civil list payment of £100,000 a year for Caroline, and she was given both Somerset House and Richmond Lodge.[51] Courtier Lord Hervey called Walpole ""the Queen\'s minister"" in recognition of their close relationship.[2] For the next ten years, Caroline had immense influence. She persuaded the King to adopt policies at the behest of Walpole, and persuaded Walpole against taking inflammatory actions. Caroline had absorbed the liberal opinions of her mentor, Queen Sophia Charlotte of Prussia, and supported clemency for the Jacobites (supporters of the rival Stuart claim to the throne), freedom of the press, and freedom of speech in Parliament.[52]', 'The memoirs of the 18th century, particularly those of John, Lord Hervey, fed perceptions that Caroline and Walpole governed her husband. Peter Quennell wrote that Hervey was the ""chronicler of this remarkable coalition"" and that she was Hervey\'s ""heroine"".[85] Using such sources, biographers of the 19th and 20th centuries credit her with aiding the establishment of the House of Hanover in Britain, in the face of Jacobite opposition. R. L. Arkell wrote ""by her acumen and geniality, [Caroline] ensured the dynasty\'s rooting itself in England"", and William Henry Wilkins said her ""gracious and dignified personality, her lofty ideals and pure life did much to counteract the unpopularity of her husband and father-in-law, and redeem the early Georgian era from utter grossness.""[86] Although modern historians tend to believe that Hervey, Wilkins and Arkell have overestimated her importance, it is nevertheless probable that Caroline of Ansbach was one of the most influential consorts in British history.[2]']"

Therefore, her policies may be seen as desperate measures to keep the House of Valois on the throne at all costs and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline.[5] Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power.[6] Catherine has been called ""the most important woman in Europe"" in the 16th century.[7]', 'She summoned church leaders from both sides to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the resulting Colloquy of Poissy ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission.[51] Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, ""she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well if only she could get the party leaders to agree"".[52] In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant Edict of Saint-Germain in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants.[53] On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the Massacre of Vassy, the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at Vassy, killing 74 and wounding 104.[54] Guise, who called the massacre ""a regrettable accident"", was cheered as a hero in the streets of Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge.

He is best known for his foreign policy of appeasement, and in particular for his signing of the Munich Agreement on 30 September 1938, ceding the German-speaking Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany led by Adolf Hitler. Following the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, which marked the beginning of the Second World War, Chamberlain announced the declaration of war on Germany two days later and led the United Kingdom through the first eight months of the war until his resignation as prime minister on 10 May 1940.', 'In December 1916, Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered Chamberlain the new position of Director of National Service, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces.[26] His tenure was marked by conflict with Lloyd George; in August 1917, having received little support from the Prime Minister, Chamberlain resigned.[27] The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George would, thereafter, be one of mutual hatred.[28]', ""Chamberlain threw himself into parliamentary work, begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work. He was chairman of the national Unhealthy Areas Committee (1919–21)[34] and in that role, had visited the slums of London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Cardiff.[35] Consequently, in March 1920, Bonar Law offered him a junior post at the Ministry of Health on behalf of the Prime Minister, but Chamberlain was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George[36] and was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership. When Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament.[37] Unionist leaders were willing to fight the 1922 election in coalition with the Lloyd George National Liberals, but on 19 October, Unionist MPs held a meeting at which they voted to fight the election as a single party. Lloyd George resigned, as did Austen Chamberlain, and Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as prime minister.[38]"", 'King George issued a statement to his people, ""After the magnificent efforts of the Prime Minister in the cause of peace it is my fervent hope that a new era of friendship and prosperity may be dawning among the peoples of the world.""[138] When the King met Duff Cooper, who resigned as First Lord of the Admiralty over the Munich Agreement, he told Cooper that he respected people who had the courage of their convictions, but could not agree with him.[138] He wrote to his mother, Queen Mary, that ""the Prime Minister was delighted with the results of his mission, as are we all.""[139] She responded to her son with anger against those who spoke against Chamberlain: ""He brought home peace, why can\'t they be grateful?""[138] Most newspapers supported Chamberlain uncritically, and he received thousands of gifts, from a silver dinner service to many of his trademark umbrellas.[140]', 'On 15 March 1939, Germany invaded the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, including Prague. Though Chamberlain\'s initial parliamentary response was, according to biographer Nick Smart, ""feeble,"" within 48\xa0hours he had spoken more forcefully against the German aggression.[154] In another Birmingham speech, on 17 March, Chamberlain warned that Hitler was attempting to ""dominate the world by force"" and that ""no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing the nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it were ever made.""[155] The Prime Minister questioned whether the invasion of Czechoslovakia was ""the end of an old adventure, or the beginning of a new"" and whether it was ""a step in the direction of an attempt to dominate the world by force.""[156] Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald said, ""whereas the Prime Minister was once a strong advocate of peace, he has now definitely swung around to the war point of view.""[157] This speech was met with widespread approval in Britain and recruitment for the armed services increased considerably.[158]', 'The Prime Minister took other steps to deter Hitler from aggression. He doubled the size of the Territorial Army, created a Ministry of Supply to expedite the provision of equipment to the armed forces, and instituted peacetime conscription.[163] The Italian invasion of Albania on 7 April 1939 led to guarantees being given to Greece and Romania.[164] On 17 June 1939, Handley Page received an order for 200 Hampden twin-engined medium bombers, and by 3 September 1939, the chain of radar stations girding the British coast was fully operational.[165]', 'No formal declaration of war was immediately made. French foreign minister Georges Bonnet stated that France could do nothing until its parliament met on the evening of 2 September. Bonnet was trying to rally support for a Munich-style summit proposed by the Italians to be held on 5 September. The British Cabinet demanded that Hitler be given an ultimatum at once and if troops were not withdrawn by the end of 2 September, war would be declared forthwith. Chamberlain and Halifax were convinced by Bonnet\'s pleas, from Paris, that France needed more time for mobilisation and evacuation. Chamberlain postponed the expiry of the ultimatum which had, in fact, not yet been served.[172] Chamberlain\'s lengthy statement to the House of Commons made no mention of an ultimatum and was consequently poorly received by the House. When Greenwood rose to ""speak for the working classes,"" Conservative backbencher and former First Lord of the Admiralty Leo Amery shouted, ""Speak for England, Arthur!"" implying that the Prime Minister was not doing so.[173] Chamberlain replied that telephone difficulties were making it hard to communicate with Paris and tried to dispel fears that the French were weakening. He had little success; too many members knew of Bonnet\'s efforts. National Labour MP and diarist Harold Nicolson later wrote, ""In those few minutes he flung away his reputation.""[174] The seeming delay gave rise to fears that Chamberlain would again seek a settlement with Hitler.[175] Chamberlain\'s last peacetime Cabinet met at 11:30 that night, with a thunderstorm raging outside, and determined that the ultimatum would be presented in Berlin at nine o\'clock the following morning—to expire two hours later, before the House of Commons convened at noon.[174] At 11:15\xa0am, 3 September 1939, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, stating that the United Kingdom was at war with Germany:', 'Chamberlain instituted a War Cabinet and invited the Labour and Liberal parties to join his government, but they declined.[178] He restored Churchill to the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the War Cabinet. Chamberlain also gave Eden a government post (dominions secretary) but not a seat in the small War Cabinet. The new First Lord deluged the Prime Minister with a sea of lengthy memos. Chamberlain castigated Churchill for sending so many memos, as the two met in War Cabinet every day.[179] Chamberlain suspected, correctly as it proved after the war, that ""these letters are for the purpose of quotation in the Book that he will write hereafter.""[180] Chamberlain also deterred some of Churchill\'s plans, such as Operation Catherine, which would have sent three heavily armoured battleships into the Baltic Sea with an aircraft carrier and other support vessels as a means of stopping shipments of iron ore to Germany.[181] With the naval war the only significant front involving the British in the early months of the conflict, the First Lord\'s obvious desire to wage a ruthless, victorious war established him as a leader-in-waiting in the public consciousness and among parliamentary colleagues.[182]', 'With little land action in the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the ""Bore War"", later renamed the ""Phoney War"" by journalists.[183] Chamberlain, in common with most Allied officials and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament.[184] The Prime Minister was reluctant to go too far in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, ""the only thing that matters is to win the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process.""[185] Government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940.[185] Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68%[186] and almost 60% in April 1940.[187]', ""In early 1940 the Allies approved a naval campaign designed to seize the northern part of Norway, a neutral country, including the key port of Narvik, and possibly also to seize the iron mines at Gällivare in northern Sweden, from which Germany obtained much of its iron ore.[188] As the Baltic froze in winter, the iron ore was then sent south by ship from Narvik. The Allies planned to begin by mining Norwegian waters, thus provoking a German reaction in Norway, and then would occupy much of the country. Unforeseen by the Allies, Germany had also planned to occupy Norway, and on 9 April German troops occupied Denmark and began an invasion of Norway. German forces quickly overran much of the country.[189] The Allies sent troops to Norway, but they met with little success, and on 26 April the War Cabinet ordered a withdrawal.[189] The Prime Minister's opponents decided to turn the adjournment debate for the Whitsun recess into a challenge to Chamberlain, who soon heard about the plan. After initial anger, Chamberlain determined to fight.[190][191]"", 'Chamberlain worked to bring his Conservative Party in line behind Churchill, working with the Chief Whip, David Margesson, to overcome members\' suspicions and dislikes of the Prime Minister. On 4 July, after the British attack on the French fleet, Churchill entered the chamber to a great cheer from Conservative MPs orchestrated by the two, and the Prime Minister was almost overcome with emotion at the first cheer he had received from his own party\'s benches since May.[204] Churchill returned the loyalty, refusing to consider Labour and Liberal attempts to expel Chamberlain from the government.[208] When criticisms of Chamberlain appeared in the press, and when Chamberlain learned that Labour intended to use an upcoming secret session of Parliament as a platform to attack him, he told Churchill that he could only defend himself by attacking Labour. The Prime Minister intervened with the Labour Party and the press and the criticism ceased, according to Chamberlain, ""like turning off a tap"".[211]', 'Chamberlain had long enjoyed excellent health, except for occasional attacks of gout,[65] but by July 1940 he was in almost constant pain. He sought treatment, and later that month entered hospital for surgery. Surgeons discovered that he was suffering from terminal bowel cancer, but they concealed it from him, instead telling him that he would not require further surgery.[214] Chamberlain resumed work in mid-August. He returned to his office on 9 September, but renewed pain, compounded by the night-time bombing of London which forced him to go to an air raid shelter and denied him rest, sapped his energy, and he left London for the last time on 19 September, returning to Highfield Park in Heckfield.[215] Chamberlain offered his resignation to Churchill on 22 September 1940. The Prime Minister was initially reluctant to accept, but as both men realised that Chamberlain would never return to work, Churchill finally allowed him to resign. The Prime Minister asked if Chamberlain would accept the highest order of British chivalry, the Order of the Garter, of which his brother had been a member. Chamberlain refused, saying he would ""prefer to die plain \'Mr Chamberlain\' like my father before me, unadorned by any title.""[216]']"

His father and half-brother spent much of their time in London, where they were serving in the Lord Salisbury Government.[13] Through a family connection, Neville Chamberlain was made a director of Elliot\'s Metal Company, which was located within a mile (1.6\xa0km) of Highbury. Chamberlain took a hands-on approach, exploring all aspects of the business.[14] In November 1897, he purchased (with assistance from his family) Hoskins & Company, a manufacturer of metal ship berths.[15] Chamberlain served as managing director of Hoskins for 17\xa0years, during which time the company prospered.[16] Chamberlain introduced a profit-sharing scheme at Hoskins which he credited with ensuring industrial peace, and opened a medical clinic for the workers.[17] His business acumen raised him in the eyes of his father, who told a friend that of his two sons, ""Neville is really the clever one"" and but for his lack of interest in politics, ""I would back him to be Prime Minister"".[18]', 'Chamberlain\'s business interests did not completely fill his time, and he indulged his love of natural history and other outdoor pursuits. He spent many Sundays working in the gardens and greenhouses at Highbury. He enjoyed long walks in the countryside, and developed a passion for hunting and fishing. Even as he approached the heights of his political career, he would contribute articles to journals such as The Countryman.[19] In 1931, he stated, ""I really can\'t consent to die until they arrange some fishing in the next world.""[20] Chamberlain travelled extensively in Europe and North Africa, made a five-month tour to India, Ceylon and Burma in 1904–05, and according to his biographer, Robert Self, was one of the more travelled Prime Ministers.[21]', ""Chamberlain also involved himself in civic activities in Birmingham.[22] In 1906, Chamberlain was a founding member of the University House Committee at Birmingham University, the president of which was his aunt, Mrs Charles Beale, wife of the university's first Vice-Chancellor.[23] He became an Official Visitor and then a director of the Birmingham General Hospital. He advocated a larger facility for the hospital, a cause in which he was eventually successful, though building did not commence until 1934 and he was still fundraising as Prime Minister. Stating that he was painfully aware of the defects of his own education, he played a part in the establishment of the University of Birmingham, of which Mason Science College became a part.[24] Joseph Chamberlain became the university's first chancellor; Neville Chamberlain was appointed to its council and later to its Board of Governors.[25]"", 'When he became Prime Minister in 1937 Chamberlain paid tribute to his wife:', ""Conscription for the Army, but not for civilian industry, had been brought in during the first half of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith's Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville's brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen.[42] In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.[43]"", 'To a great extent Chamberlain\'s actual responsibilities were left vague by Lloyd George.[44] On his appointment Lloyd George implied in the House of Commons that ""compulsion"" (the industrial equivalent of conscription) was to be extended to industry and that Chamberlain would soon produce a system of industrial enrolment.[45] But Chamberlain found his work to be handicapped by the Prime Minister\'s political manoeuvres and need to appease the trade unions. As Chamberlain sought to maximise the number of workers subject both to military conscription and compulsion into industry, Lloyd George pledged to the unions that he would oppose any sort of ""industrial conscription"".[46] Although Chamberlain repeatedly made proposals for mandatory service, they were turned down by Lloyd George and his War Cabinet.[46] The Army still controlled its own recruitment at this stage, whilst Chamberlain met with resistance from the Ministries of Munitions and Labour. Chamberlain\'s proposal that all men under 21 be drafted from industry into the Army was blocked by Minister of Munitions Addison (19 January 1917), as it would have reduced munitions output by conscripting skilled young men who had already spent time in apprenticeships.[47]', 'Chamberlain had formed a close friendship with his cousin, Norman Chamberlain, who had also served on the City Council and who shared the future Prime Minister\'s social ideals. In December 1917, Norman Chamberlain was reported missing in action during the Battle of Cambrai, and in February 1918, Norman\'s body was found—a great blow to Neville Chamberlain, who described Norman as ""the most intimate friend I had"".[56] Through the rest of his career, Neville Chamberlain laboured to further the ideals of his cousin, and wrote his biography—the only book he ever wrote. Some historians relate Norman\'s death to a hatred of war on his cousin\'s part which led to appeasement; according to Chamberlain\'s biographer Nick Smart, the death did not cause Chamberlain to hate World War I, and any influence on his later positions is far from certain.[56]', 'After some hesitation as to his future career, Chamberlain determined to enter Parliament, though, after his experience with National Service, he feared that he would only have a brief, unsatisfying parliamentary career.[57] Wishing to stand for a Birmingham constituency, he initially had some difficulty in finding one.[58] The Representation of the People Act 1918 gave Birmingham five additional seats,[59] and Chamberlain was adopted as candidate for one of the new seats, Birmingham Ladywood.[60] With the election on hold until the conclusion of the war, he continued his work in Birmingham. Shortly after the Armistice, his sister Beatrice died in the influenza pandemic, and Chamberlain mourned her, ""She had the warmest heart."" [61] With the war ended, a general election was called almost immediately. Chamberlain stood as a Unionist (as the Conservative Party was known from 1912 to 1925) and was given the ""coupon"" or letter of endorsement granted by Coalition party leaders Lloyd George and Bonar Law to approved candidates, though he declined to make any use of it.[60] He was elected with almost 70% of the vote and a majority of 6,833.[62] At age 49, he remains the oldest man to enter Parliament for the first time and later become Prime Minister.[63]', ""Chamberlain threw himself into Parliamentary work, begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work. When Austen Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the continued coalition government led by the Liberal Prime Minister, Lloyd George, tried to recruit him to serve on an additional committee, Neville Chamberlain informed his half-brother that he could only serve if it met between midnight and 7:30\xa0am.[64] Chamberlain took time to assure the future of the Birmingham Savings Bank, and Parliament passed an act which removed onerous restrictions from the bank.[41] In March 1920, he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health by Bonar Law on behalf of the Prime Minister, but was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George despite Bonar Law's warnings that Chamberlain, now past fifty, might never be offered another chance to serve in government, as Lloyd George was likely to remain premier for a very long time.[65] Chamberlain was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership, and when Bonar Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as leader of the Unionists in Parliament.[66]"", 'Unionist backbenchers had long been restive as Lloyd George granted the Liberals in the Coalition more than their proportionate share of offices.[67] In October 1922, discontent among Unionists against the Lloyd George Coalition Government erupted. When Unionist MPs were summoned to the Carlton Club for a meeting to receive their instructions for the forthcoming election, which, as in 1918 was to be fought in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals, they instead rebelled and voted to fight the election as a single party. Lloyd George resigned as Prime Minister. Most Unionist leaders, including Austen Chamberlain, had supported the Coalition and advocated its continuation. They resigned from their government and party offices,[68] with Austen Chamberlain writing, ""The meeting today rejected our advice. Other men who have given other counsels must inherit our burden"".[69] Bonar Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as Prime Minister.[68] Neville Chamberlain was in Canada at the time of the meeting and so was not forced to choose between supporting his brother\'s leadership and bringing down a Prime Minister he despised.[70]', ""In May 1923, Bonar Law was diagnosed with advanced terminal throat cancer. He immediately resigned, and King George V sent for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stanley Baldwin, to form a government. Baldwin served as his own Chancellor for three months while he sought a successor and then promoted Chamberlain to the position.[78] Chamberlain had little time for any policy changes, as he served only five months in the office and did not present a budget. Though the Unionists had an ample majority in the House of Commons and the current Parliament had four years to run, Baldwin decided that a general election was needed and that the Unionists should fight it on the issue of tariff reform. He hoped to gain both a personal mandate as Prime Minister and a policy mandate for his tariff proposals. He miscalculated badly: in the general election held in December 1923 the Unionists remained the largest party in the House of Commons, but were outnumbered by the combined Liberal and Labour MPs. The Baldwin Government retained office until it was defeated when Parliament assembled in January 1924, and Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister. Chamberlain's majority in Birmingham Ladywood was cut yet again, this time to 1,500\xa0votes.[79]"", 'Though Chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during the 1926 General Strike, in general he had poor relations with the Labour opposition. Future Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee complained that Chamberlain ""always treated us like dirt"", and Chamberlain wrote in April 1927, ""More and more do I feel an utter contempt for their lamentable stupidity.""[92] One Labour MP referred to Chamberlain as ""a miniature Mussolini"",[93] and others claimed that Chamberlain\'s policies had allowed entire communities to starve, dubbing him the ""Minister of Death"".[94] His poor relations with the Labour Party eventually played a major part in his downfall as Prime Minister.[95]', ""In 1931, the MacDonald Government faced a serious crisis, as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120\xa0million. As this information became public, there was a run on the pound, depleting the nation's gold reserves. The Labour Party refused to consider the massive cuts in unemployment compensation which would be needed to balance the budget, and Prime Minister MacDonald sought support from outside his party. With Baldwin on holiday in France, Chamberlain negotiated for the Conservatives. Chamberlain told MacDonald that the Conservatives would only join a coalition if the full recommended cuts in unemployment compensation were made. Finally, on 24 August 1931, the Labour Government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government, supported by most Conservative and Liberal MPs and a minority of the Labour Party.[108] Chamberlain once more returned to the Ministry of Health.[109] The National Government was intended as only a temporary expedient, but governed Britain until Chamberlain's fall in 1940.[110] In the ensuing General Election, the National Government won 554 of the 615\xa0seats in the House of Commons, with 473 of its supporters Conservative MPs.[109]"", 'Chamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated. In June 1933, Britain hosted the World Monetary and Economic Conference. Describing the event as the ""most crucial gathering since Versailles"", Time magazine featured Chamberlain on its cover, referring to him as ""that mighty mover behind British Cabinet scenes, lean, taciturn, iron-willed\xa0... It is no secret that Scot MacDonald remains Prime Minister by Prime Mover Chamberlain\'s leave.""[121] The Conference came to nothing, when US President Franklin Roosevelt sent word that he would not consider any war debt cancellation.[118] After the US Congress passed the Johnson Act, forbidding loans to nations in default on their debts, Chamberlain felt that Britain could not pay the entire debt, and, as the Act made no distinction between a partial and complete default, the Chancellor entirely suspended Britain\'s war debt payments to the US.[122]', 'In 1935, MacDonald stood down as Prime Minister, taking Baldwin\'s post as Lord President of the council, and Baldwin became Prime Minister for the third time. Chamberlain remained at the Treasury, almost the only Cabinet member not to be moved in the subsequent reshuffle. Chamberlain was still spoken of as \'heir apparent\', but feared being eclipsed by a younger man. To be seen more as the second man of the Government, he insisted on moving into Number 11 Downing Street, the Chancellor\'s traditional residence, which had been occupied by Baldwin during MacDonald\'s premiership. Baldwin indicated his desire to remain in office until his 70th birthday in August 1937, but Chamberlain doubted he would last that long.[128] In the 1935 General Election, the Conservative-dominated National Government lost 90\xa0seats from the massive majority of 1931, but still retained an overwhelming majority of 255 in the House of Commons. During the campaign, Deputy Labour Leader Arthur Greenwood attacked Chamberlain for spending money on re-armament, stating that the re-armament policy was ""the merest scaremongering, disgraceful in a statesman of Mr. Chamberlain\'s responsible position, to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments"".[129]', 'Polemics such as Guilty Men, which helped demolish Chamberlain\'s reputation for his foreign policy as premier, also touched on his record as minister. These books blamed the National Government, in which Chamberlain had taken a leading role, for a failure to rearm.[132] Historian David Dutton suggested in his book on Chamberlain that the damage to his reputation, both as Prime Minister and as a Cabinet minister, could have been contained had the Conservative Party defended his policies, but for 23\xa0years after Chamberlain\'s death, the party leaders (Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) had made reputations as opponents of appeasement, and who were little minded to defend Chamberlain\'s record as a minister. The Labour landslide in the 1945 General Election cemented this inclination, with Macmillan stating that it was not ""Churchill who had brought the Conservative party so low. On the contrary it was the recent history of the Party, with its pre-war record of unemployment and its failure to preserve peace.""[133]', 'The adoption of policies using Keynesian economics led to other criticisms of Chamberlain\'s ministerial record. Popular wisdom then held that governments could keep unemployment at a low level through spending. Chamberlain\'s acceptance of unemployment as an inevitable part of the business cycle was seen as outdated.[134] In 1958, as Prime Minister, Macmillan described a report advocating limits on public investment as ""a very bad paper. Indeed a disgraceful paper. It might have been written by Mr. Neville Chamberlain\'s Government.""[133]']"

After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1927. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race at that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems."", 'Chandler entered politics when he was named chairman of the Woodford County Democratic Committee.[8] In 1928, he was appointed master commissioner of the Woodford County circuit court.[21] The following year, he was elected as a Democrat to represent the 22nd district in the Kentucky Senate.[3][19] As a member of the Senate, he was part of a Democratic coalition that passed legislation to strip Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson of many of his statutory powers.[22]', ""As the 1931 gubernatorial election approached, Chandler and Prestonsburg native Jack Howard were mentioned as candidates for lieutenant governor.[23] US Representative Fred M. Vinson backed Howard, a fellow Eastern Kentuckian, but political bosses Billy Klair, Johnson N. Camden Jr., and Ben Johnson supported Chandler.[23] The support of another political boss, Mickey Brennan, gave Chandler the edge at the party's nominating convention.[23] Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ruby Laffoon also owed his selection to the machinations of the state's political bosses, notably his uncle, Representative Polk Laffoon.[23] Problematically, Chandler was an ally of former Governor J. C. W. Beckham, Louisville Courier-Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham, and political boss Percy Haly, which put him at odds with Laffoon, a member of a Democratic faction that was headed by Russellville political boss Thomas Rhea and opposed to Beckham, Worth, and Haly.[24] Despite the disharmony within the ticket, the worsening of the Great Depression under Republican President Herbert Hoover and Governor Sampson ensured a Democratic victory.[23] Chandler was elected over John C. Worsham, by a vote of 426,247 to 353,573.[3] In a break with precedent, Chandler set up an office on the executive floor of the state capitol and worked there full-time. Previous lieutenant governors had stayed in Frankfort only during legislative sessions, when they were charged with presiding over the State Senate.[25]"", ""One of Chandler's first acts as governor was to secure the repeal of the sales tax passed under Laffoon.[28] He also successfully lobbied the legislature to abolish the two-round primary, in favor of a single primary for future elections.[24] Knowing that he would need to raise revenue to offset the repeal of the sales tax and bring the state's expenditures in line with its income, Chandler appointed a commission headed by ex-Governor Beckham to draft suggested budgetary legislation.[35] Knowing that lobbyists hostile to the suggestions would likely try to encourage legislative gridlock until the constitutionally-mandated end of the 60-day session, Chandler asked his allies in the General Assembly to adjourn after 39 days to allow him to call a special legislative session that would not be time-limited and could entertain only the agenda he specified.[35] Legislators obliged this request.[35]"", ""On October 9, 1939, following the death of Senator Logan, Chandler resigned as governor, elevating Lieutenant Governor Keen Johnson to the governorship.

Farnsley in the Democratic primary and Republican Walter B. Smith by a vote of 561,151 to 401,812 in the November 5, 1940, general election.[56] Although he never forgave Roosevelt for backing Barkley in the 1938 senatorial primary, he generally supported the Roosevelt administration except for parts of the New Deal.[57]"", ""On October 9, 1939, following the death of Senator Logan, Chandler resigned as governor, elevating Lieutenant Governor Keen Johnson to the governorship.

Born into a cricketing family—his grandfather and brother also captained Australia—Chappell made a hesitant start to international cricket playing as a right-hand middle-order batsman and spin bowler. He found his niche when promoted to bat at number three. Known as ""Chappelli"", he earned a reputation as one of the greatest captains the game has seen.[1][2][3][4] Chappell\'s blunt verbal manner led to a series of confrontations with opposition players and cricket administrators; the issue of sledging first arose during his tenure as captain, and he was a driving force behind the professionalisation of Australian cricket in the 1970s.[5] He was the captain of the Australian squad which finished as runners-up at the 1975 Cricket World Cup.', ""The aggressive style of Sobers and of South Australia captain Les Favell heavily influenced Chappell during his formative years in senior cricket.[16] In 1962–63, Chappell made his initial first-class century against a New South Wales team led by Australian captain Richie Benaud, who was bemused by the young batsman's habit of gritting his teeth as he faced up; to Benaud, it looked as if he was grinning.[17] Chappell spent the northern summer of 1963 as a professional in England's Lancashire League with Ramsbottom and played a single first-class match for Lancashire against Cambridge University.[18]"", ""In 1963–64, Chappell batted at number three for SA for the first time, in a match against Queensland at Brisbane, and scored 205 not out.[19] He was the youngest member of the SA team that won the Sheffield Shield that season.[20] A century against Victoria early the following season resulted in Chappell's selection for a one-off Test against Pakistan at Melbourne in December 1964.

He became heir apparent to the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland in 1612 upon the death of his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to Infanta Maria Anna of Spain culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiation. Two years later, shortly after his accession, he married Henrietta Maria of France.', ""Unfortunately for James, negotiation with Spain proved unpopular with both the public and James's court.[19] The English Parliament was actively hostile towards Spain and Catholicism, and thus, when called by James in 1621, the members hoped for an enforcement of recusancy laws, a naval campaign against Spain, and a Protestant marriage for the Prince of Wales.[20] James's Lord Chancellor, Francis Bacon, was impeached before the House of Lords for corruption.[21] The impeachment was the first since 1459 without the king's official sanction in the form of a bill of attainder. The incident set an important precedent as the process of impeachment would later be used against Charles and his supporters the Duke of Buckingham, Archbishop William Laud, and the Earl of Strafford. James insisted that the House of Commons be concerned exclusively with domestic affairs, while the members protested that they had the privilege of free speech within the Commons' walls, demanding war with Spain and a Protestant princess of Wales.[22] Like his father, Charles considered discussion of his marriage in the Commons impertinent and an infringement of his father's royal prerogative.[23] In January 1622, James dissolved Parliament, angry at what he perceived as the members' impudence and intransigence.[24]"", ""Rather than direct involvement in the European land war, the English Parliament preferred a relatively inexpensive naval attack on Spanish colonies in the New World, hoping for the capture of the Spanish treasure fleets. Parliament voted to grant a subsidy of £140,000, an insufficient sum for Charles's war plans.[48] Moreover, the House of Commons limited its authorisation for royal collection of tonnage and poundage (two varieties of customs duties) to a year, although previous sovereigns since Henry VI had been granted the right for life.[49] In this manner, Parliament could delay approval of the rates until after a full-scale review of customs revenue.[50] The bill made no progress in the House of Lords past its first reading.[51] Although no act of Parliament for the levy of tonnage and poundage was obtained, Charles continued to collect the duties.[52]"", 'A poorly conceived and executed naval expedition against Spain under Buckingham\'s leadership went badly, and the House of Commons began proceedings for the impeachment of the duke.[53] In May 1626, Charles nominated Buckingham as Chancellor of Cambridge University in a show of support,[54] and had two members who had spoken against Buckingham—Dudley Digges and Sir John Eliot—arrested at the door of the House. The Commons was outraged by the imprisonment of two of their members, and after about a week in custody, both were released.[55] On 12 June 1626, the Commons launched a direct protestation attacking Buckingham, stating, ""We protest before your Majesty and the whole world that until this great person be removed from intermeddling with the great affairs of state, we are out of hope of any good success; and do fear that any money we shall or can give will, through his misemployment, be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of this your kingdom than otherwise, as by lamentable experience we have found those large supplies formerly and lately given.""[56] Despite the protests, Charles refused to dismiss his friend, dismissing Parliament instead.[57]', ""In January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue.[77] Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies in light of the case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage.[78] Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right. When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March,[79] members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down in his chair so that the session could be prolonged long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism, and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber.[80] The provocation was too much for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter,[81] thereby turning the men into martyrs[82] and giving popular cause to their protest.[83]"", ""Charles continued peace negotiations with the Scots in a bid to gain time before launching a new military campaign. Because of his financial weakness, he was forced to call Parliament into session in an attempt to raise funds for such a venture.[129] Both the English and Irish parliaments were summoned in the early months of 1640.[130] In March 1640, the Irish Parliament duly voted in a subsidy of £180,000 with the promise to raise an army 9,000 strong by the end of May.[130] But in the English general election in March, court candidates fared badly,[131] and Charles's dealings with the English Parliament in April quickly reached stalemate.[132] The earls of Northumberland and Strafford attempted to broker a compromise whereby the king would agree to forfeit ship money in exchange for £650,000 (although the cost of the coming war was estimated at £1\xa0million).[133] Nevertheless, this alone was insufficient to produce consensus in the Commons.[134] The Parliamentarians' calls for further reforms were ignored by Charles, who still retained the support of the House of Lords. Despite the protests of the Earl of Northumberland,[135] the Short Parliament (as it came to be known) was dissolved in May 1640, less than a month after it assembled.[136]"", 'Also in early May, Charles assented to an unprecedented Act that forbade the dissolution of the English Parliament without its consent.[167] In the following months, ship money, fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful, and the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished.[168] All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.[169] The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these failed in the Lords.[170]', 'In November 1641, the House of Commons passed the Grand Remonstrance, a long list of grievances against actions by Charles\'s ministers committed since the beginning of his reign (that were asserted to be part of a grand Catholic conspiracy of which the king was an unwitting member),[186] but it was in many ways a step too far by Pym and passed by only 11 votes, 159 to 148.[187] Furthermore, the Remonstrance had very little support in the House of Lords, which the Remonstrance attacked.[188] The tension was heightened by news of the Irish rebellion, coupled with inaccurate rumours of Charles\'s complicity.[189] Throughout November, a series of alarmist pamphlets published stories of atrocities in Ireland,[190] including massacres of New English settlers by the native Irish who could not be controlled by the Old English lords.[191] Rumours of ""papist"" conspiracies circulated in England,[192] and English anti-Catholic opinion was strengthened, damaging Charles\'s reputation and authority.[193] The English Parliament distrusted Charles\'s motivations when he called for funds to put down the Irish rebellion; many members of the Commons suspected that forces he raised might later be used against Parliament itself.[194] Pym\'s Militia Bill was intended to wrest control of the army from the king, but it did not have the support of the Lords, let alone Charles.[195] Instead, the Commons passed the bill as an ordinance, which they claimed did not require royal assent.[196] The Militia Ordinance appears to have prompted more members of the Lords to support the king.[197] In an attempt to strengthen his position, Charles generated great antipathy in London, which was already fast falling into lawlessness, when he placed the Tower of London under the command of Colonel Thomas Lunsford, an infamous, albeit efficient, career officer.[198] When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to impeach his wife for supposedly conspiring with the Irish rebels, he decided to take drastic action.[199]', 'Charles suspected, probably correctly, that some members of the English Parliament had colluded with the invading Scots.[200] On 3 January 1642, Charles directed Parliament to give up five specific members of the Commons—Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, William Strode and Sir Arthur Haselrig—and one peer, Lord Mandeville, on the grounds of high treason.[201] When Parliament refused, it was possibly Henrietta Maria who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force, which he resolved to do personally.[202] But news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him, and the wanted men slipped away by boat shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January.[203] Having displaced Speaker William Lenthall from his chair, the king asked him where the MPs had fled. Lenthall, on his knees,[204] famously replied, ""May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.""[205] Charles abjectly declared ""all my birds have flown"", and was forced to retire empty-handed.[206]', ""The botched arrest attempt was politically disastrous for Charles.[207] No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons, and his unprecedented invasion of the chamber to arrest its members was considered a grave breach of parliamentary privilege.[208] In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters' efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder.[209]"", ""Parliament held Charles under house arrest at Holdenby House in Northamptonshire until Cornet George Joyce took him by threat of force from Holdenby on 3 June in the name of the New Model Army.[238] By this time, mutual suspicion had developed between Parliament, which favoured army disbandment and presbyterianism, and the New Model Army, which was primarily officered by congregationalist Independents, who sought a greater political role.[239] Charles was eager to exploit the widening divisions, and apparently viewed Joyce's actions as an opportunity rather than a threat.[240] He was taken first to Newmarket, at his own suggestion,[241] and then transferred to Oatlands and subsequently Hampton Court, while more fruitless negotiations took place.[242] By November, he determined that it would be in his best interests to escape—perhaps to France, Southern England or Berwick-upon-Tweed, near the Scottish border.[243] He fled Hampton Court on 11 November, and from the shores of Southampton Water made contact with Colonel Robert Hammond, Parliamentary Governor of the Isle of Wight, whom he apparently believed to be sympathetic.[244] But Hammond confined Charles in Carisbrooke Castle and informed Parliament that Charles was in his custody.[245]"", 'Charles was moved to Hurst Castle at the end of 1648, and thereafter to Windsor Castle.[257] In January 1649, the Rump House of Commons indicted him for treason; the House of Lords rejected the charge.[258] The idea of trying a king was novel.[259] The Chief Justices of the three common law courts of England—Henry Rolle, Oliver St John and John Wilde—all opposed the indictment as unlawful.[260] The Rump Commons declared itself capable of legislating alone, passed a bill creating a separate court for Charles\'s trial, and declared the bill an act without the need for royal assent.[261] The High Court of Justice established by the Act consisted of 135 commissioners, but many either refused to serve or chose to stay away.[262] Only 68 (all firm Parliamentarians) attended Charles\'s trial on charges of high treason and ""other high crimes"" that began on 20 January 1649 in Westminster Hall.[263] John Bradshaw acted as President of the Court, and the prosecution was led by Solicitor General John Cook.[264]', ""no earthly power can justly call me (who am your King) in question as a delinquent\xa0... this day's proceeding cannot be warranted by God's laws; for, on the contrary, the authority of obedience unto Kings is clearly warranted, and strictly commanded in both the Old and New Testament\xa0... for the law of this land, I am no less confident, that no learned lawyer will affirm that an impeachment can lie against the King, they all going in his name: and one of their maxims is, that the King can do no wrong\xa0... the higher House is totally excluded; and for the House of Commons, it is too well known that the major part of them are detained or deterred from sitting\xa0... the arms I took up were only to defend the fundamental laws of this kingdom against those who have supposed my power hath totally changed the ancient government.[272]"", 'He walked under guard from St James\'s Palace, where he had been confined, to the Palace of Whitehall, where an execution scaffold had been erected in front of the Banqueting House.[280] Charles was separated from spectators by large ranks of soldiers, and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold.[281] He blamed his fate on his failure to prevent the execution of his loyal servant Strafford: ""An unjust sentence that I suffered to take effect, is punished now by an unjust sentence on me.""[282] He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any, ""but I must tell you that their liberty and freedom consists in having government\xa0... It is not their having a share in the government; that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean different things.""[283] He continued, ""I shall go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no disturbance can be.""[284]', 'With the monarchy overthrown, England became a republic or ""Commonwealth"". The House of Lords was abolished by the Rump Commons, and executive power was assumed by a Council of State.[303] All significant military opposition in Britain and Ireland was extinguished by the forces of Oliver Cromwell in the Anglo-Scottish War and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.[304] Cromwell forcibly disbanded the Rump Parliament in 1653,[305] thereby establishing the Protectorate with himself as Lord Protector.[306] Upon his death in 1658, he was briefly succeeded by his ineffective son, Richard.[307] Parliament was reinstated, and the monarchy was restored to Charles I\'s eldest son, Charles II, in 1660.[308]', ""Charles's unprecedented 1642 invasion of the House of Commons' chamber, a grave violation of the liberties of Parliament, and his unsuccessful attempt to arrest five Members of Parliament is commemorated annually at the State Opening of Parliament.[309]"", ""Partly inspired by his visit to the Spanish court in 1623,[310] Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled.[311] In Spain, he sat for a sketch by Velázquez, and acquired works by Titian and Correggio, among others.[312] In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the Banqueting House, Whitehall, by Rubens and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as van Honthorst, Mytens, and van Dyck.[313] His close associates, including the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arundel, shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall Group.[314] In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua, which included work by Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Caravaggio, del Sarto and Mantegna.[315] His collection grew further to encompass Bernini, Bruegel, Leonardo, Holbein, Hollar, Tintoretto and Veronese, and self-portraits by both Dürer and Rembrandt.[316] By Charles's death, there were an estimated 1,760 paintings,[317] most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament.[318]""]"

Charles acquiesced to these new laws even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his cousin, King Louis XIV of France. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, Titus Oates's fabrication of a supposed Popish Plot sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, had become a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties. Charles sided with the Tories and, after the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681 and ruled alone until his death in 1685."", 'The restrictions against royalist candidates and voters were widely ignored, and the elections resulted in a House of Commons that was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians.[23] The so-called Convention Parliament assembled on 25 April 1660, and soon afterwards welcomed the Declaration of Breda, in which Charles promised lenience and tolerance. There would be liberty of conscience, and Anglican church policy would not be harsh. He would not exile past enemies nor confiscate their wealth. There would be pardons for nearly all his opponents except the regicides. Above all, Charles promised to rule in cooperation with Parliament.[24] The English Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invite him to return, a message that reached Charles at Breda on 8 May 1660.[25] In Ireland, a convention had been called earlier in the year and had already declared for Charles. On 14 May, he was proclaimed king in Dublin.[26]', ""Later in 1678, Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on the charge of high treason. Although much of the nation had sought war with Catholic France, Charles had secretly negotiated with Louis XIV, trying to reach an agreement under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles's wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Danby from the impeachment trial, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.[66]"", 'The new English Parliament, which met in March of the same year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had intended to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with insufficient funds voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the House of Lords attempted to impose the punishment of exile—which the Commons thought too mild—the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been required to do so many times during his reign, Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the Tower of London, in which he was held for another five years.[67]', ""Charles faced a political storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being next in line to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley and a member of the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Lord Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The Abhorrers—those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the Petitioners—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).[118]"", ""Charles's opposition to the Exclusion Bill angered some Protestants. Protestant conspirators formulated the Rye House Plot, a plan to murder him and the Duke of York as they returned to London after horse races in Newmarket. A great fire, however, destroyed Charles's lodgings at Newmarket, which forced him to leave the races early, thus inadvertently avoiding the planned attack. News of the failed plot was leaked.[121] Protestant politicians such as the Earl of Essex, Algernon Sydney, Lord Russell and the Duke of Monmouth were implicated in the plot. Essex slit his own throat while imprisoned in the Tower of London; Sydney and Russell were executed for high treason on very flimsy evidence; and the Duke of Monmouth went into exile at the court of William of Orange. Lord Danby and the surviving Catholic lords held in the Tower were released and the king's Catholic brother, James, acquired greater influence at court.[122] Titus Oates was convicted and imprisoned for defamation.[123]"", 'On his deathbed, Charles asked his brother, James, to look after his mistresses: ""be well to Portsmouth, and let not poor Nelly starve"".[130] He told his courtiers, ""I am sorry, gentlemen, for being such a time a-dying"",[131] and expressed regret at his treatment of his wife. On the last evening of his life he was received into the Catholic Church, in the presence of Father John Huddleston, though the extent to which he was fully conscious or committed, and with whom the idea originated, is unclear.[132] He was buried in Westminster Abbey ""without any manner of pomp""[131] on 14 February.[133]']"

The winners of the round robin groups in April would compete with the defending champion United States team in a knockout format for the title in November. Belgium was placed in a group with Australia, France, and Russia. Each tie was contested over one day as a best-of-three rubbers, two in singles and the last in doubles. Clijsters only played singles, while Els Callens and Laurence Courtois played all three doubles matches. Although Clijsters narrowly lost her debut to Jelena Dokic of Australia by a score of 9–7 in the third set, her teammates were able to secure the tie. She won her other two matches against Nathalie Tauziat of France and Anna Kournikova of Russia, both of which were crucial as Belgium won each of those ties 2–1 as well to win the group. In the semifinals, Henin returned to the team as they faced the United States, the hosts for the final rounds. After Henin lost to Monica Seles, Clijsters needed to defeat Lindsay Davenport to keep Belgium in the tournament. She won the second set, but ultimately lost the match.[164]', 'The following year, the format for the Fed Cup changed again. The entire competition was played out in November. The three round robin pools were reduced to two and the winners of each pool would contest a final tie for the title. Belgium\'s team of Clijsters, Henin, Callens, and Courtois from the 2000 final all returned for 2001. The United States withdrew before the start of the event, citing security concerns a few months after the 11 September terrorist attacks. With Henin and Clijsters exclusively playing singles, and Callens and Courtois playing doubles, Belgium won all nine of their rubbers against Spain, Germany, and Australia to advance to the final.

Each tie was played as a best-of-five rubbers, with four singles followed by one doubles. In the first round against Russia, both Clijsters and Henin made themselves available and won three out of four singles matches to advance.[166] Although Henin missed the semifinal, Clijsters and Kirsten Flipkens were able to lead Belgium to a victory over the United States, who were also short-handed without Lindsay Davenport or the Williams sisters.[167] However, Clijsters was forced to miss the Fed Cup final due to a wrist injury.[101] Henin and Flipkens returned for the final, which Belgium hosted against Italy.

After completing flight training in England, he served on the Western Front with No.\xa04 Squadron AFC, operating Sopwith Camels. He was credited with 29 aerial victories, and his achievements were recognised with the Distinguished Service Order, the Distinguished Flying Cross and two bars, and a mention in despatches.', 'Still instructing in England following the end of the war, Cobby was chosen to lead the AFC\'s Anzac Day flypast over London before the Prince of Wales on 25\xa0April 1919, in concert with a parade by Australian soldiers.[4][5] By 2:30 in the afternoon, he was taking his 50-strong aerial formation through a series of wild stunts over the alarmed Prince\'s head, and later told the story that he flew so close to the marching soldiers that their bayonets almost pierced his undercarriage.[4] Cobby later said that this was: ""probably the most foolish thing I have ever done"".[27] He returned to Australia in May 1919,[6] and married Hilda Maude Urban in Caulfield, Victoria, on 24\xa0April 1920; the couple had a son and a daughter. Following the disbandment of the AFC, Cobby joined the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force in 1921.[2] Ranked flying officer (honorary flight lieutenant), he was one of the original 21 officers on the air force\'s strength at its formation that March.[28] His first posting, along with most of his colleagues, was to a mixed squadron equipped primarily with S.E.5s and DH.9s at No.\xa01 Flying Training School, based at RAAF Point Cook.[29]  Flight Lieutenant Cobby became Commanding Officer (CO) of No.\xa01 Squadron when it was reformed at Point Cook on 1\xa0July 1925, serving in the position until August 1926.[30]', 'In August 1944, Cobby became AOC of No.\xa010 Operational Group (No.\xa010 OG), soon to be renamed the Australian First Tactical Air Force (1st TAF).[1][41] In this role he commanded 20,000 personnel in the RAAF\'s major mobile strike force in the South West Pacific, consisting of fighter, close support, and airfield construction units.[51] Cobby expressed misgivings concerning the command arrangements that saw RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne responsible for No.\xa010 OG\'s administration, while its operational tasking was to be passed down through RAAF Command, the United States Thirteenth Air Force and Headquarters South West Pacific Area. He believed this required him to ""try and serve two masters"", a situation he found ""unworkable"".[52] In the period 22–25 December 1944, 1st TAF flew 513 Kittyhawk and Beaufighter sorties against targets in Halmahera. The following month, it undertook a further 661 sorties against targets in Halmahera, Celebes, Morotai and the Vogelkop.[53]', 'By early 1945, Japanese air power in the South West Pacific had been virtually destroyed, and 1st TAF was increasingly assigned to garrison duties and harassing enemy bases on islands bypassed by US forces in their advance on the Philippines.[54]  During March and April, 1st TAF prepared for the invasion of Tarakan, an operation based around a mistaken judgement made by officers at Cobby\'s headquarters that the island\'s airstrip could be rapidly repaired and used to support the Borneo campaign.[55] The relegation of fighter units to what appeared to be strategically unimportant ground attack missions led to a crisis in morale that precipitated the so-called ""Morotai Mutiny"" in April 1945, when eight of Cobby\'s senior pilots, including Australia\'s leading ace in the war, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, tendered their resignations in protest.[54][56] Although one of the ""mutineers"", Group Captain Wilf Arthur, had earlier voiced his concerns to Cobby and his headquarters staff regarding the efficacy of 1st TAF\'s tasking, the AOC was taken aback by the resignations.[53][57] He spoke to the officers individually and as a group, asking them, ""Is this something against me, or having a go against me in this, because if so, if you feel that I have fallen down in my job, I will straight away ask to be recalled,"" to which they replied, ""It has nothing to do with you.""[58] Cobby reported the incident to his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, who informed the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, and the Allied Air Forces Commander, Lieutenant General George Kenney. All made their way to Morotai and interviewed the pilots involved, and all concluded that Cobby should be relieved of his command.[59]']"

She successfully used economic incentives to bring a Toyota manufacturing plant to Georgetown, Kentucky in 1986.

As clerk, she compiled and distributed a brochure about the new role of the Supreme Court, and worked with the state department of education to create a teacher's manual for use in the public schools, detailing the changes effected in the court system as a result of the constitutional amendment.

On December 3, 1991, Combs was caught in a flash flood while driving and was killed."", 'Unable to afford college tuition, Combs worked at a local drug store and did small jobs for various residents of his community.[4] In 1929, his mother arranged for him to work at a coal company in Williamsburg and attend Cumberland College (then a junior college).[4] The coal company job did not materialize, but Combs was able to afford three semesters at Cumberland by sweeping floors and firing furnaces in campus buildings.[2][5] In mid-1930, he began working as a clerk for the state highway department.[6] This was one of several patronage jobs that were usually awarded by the governor, but the Democratically controlled state legislature had stripped Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson of his statutory appointment powers, giving them instead to a three-man highway commission composed of Democratic Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Democratic Highway Commissioner Ben Johnson, and Dan Talbott.[7] This allowed Combs, a Democrat, to secure the position.[8]', ""With the end of Governor Nunn's term approaching, a rivalry for leadership of the state Democratic party developed between Lieutenant Governor Wendell H. Ford, who had served as Combs' chief administrative assistant during his gubernatorial term, and Julian M. Carroll, speaker of the state House of Representatives.[56] As soon as Combs resigned from the Court of Appeals, Democratic leaders began asking him to seek the party's gubernatorial nomination in 1971, uniting the party behind him rather than splintering it between Ford and Carroll.[56] In June 1970, Carroll announced his intent to run for lieutenant governor, indicating that he would like to serve under Combs as governor.[56] While Combs considered whether or not to seek the nomination, Ford declared his candidacy.[56] Days later, Combs also entered the race.[57]"", ""After the 1971 primary, Combs retired from politics and resumed his law practice, maintaining an office in Frankfort. He moved to Louisville, becoming the partner of John Tarrant in Tarrant, Combs and Bullitt, and then in Wyatt, Tarrant and Combs, with Wilson Wyatt. He continued to represent large coal companies, drawing the ire of local environmentalist and author Harry M. Caudill, who asserted that Combs claimed to represent the powerless while actually representing the powerful.[2] He was active in the formation of the Rural Housing and Development Corporation and served on the Council on Higher Education.[11] He also served on President Jimmy Carter's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament.[61]"", 'On October 3, 1984, leaders of the Council for Better Education asked Combs to represent them in a legal challenge to Kentucky\'s school financing system, which it claimed unfairly discriminated against poorer school systems in the state.[64] Combs felt the lawsuit would be difficult to win and could cause retaliation against his other clients by state government officials.[64] He needed this lawsuit ""about like a hog needs a side saddle"", he would later claim; nevertheless, he agreed to take the case if the council could convince thirty to forty percent of the state\'s school boards to join it.[64][65] The Council eventually persuaded 66 of the 177 school boards to join.[66] Working pro bono, Combs assembled a legal team that included Kern Alexander, a Kentucky native and education law expert who was named president of Western Kentucky University in November 1985.[66]', ""Combs first attempted to gain legislative concessions that might preclude the need for a lawsuit.[67] Governor Martha Layne Collins proposed an education reform agenda and called the legislature into special session in mid-1985 to consider it.[67] The legislature enacted a corporate income tax to raise $300\xa0million aimed at reducing class sizes, but the council was seeking more fundamental structural changes to the system and deemed the increased funds insufficient to equalize its members' standing with that of more affluent school districts.[68][69] Dissatisfied with the results of the special session, Combs and the Council filed their suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, on November 20, 1985.[69] The governor, state superintendent, state treasurer, leaders of both houses of the state legislature, and every member of the state board of education were named as defendants in the case.[69]"", 'The court set out nine minimum standards. In response to the court\'s ruling, the General Assembly passed the 1990 Kentucky Education Reform Act, which radically altered Kentucky\'s school system, providing mechanisms to equalize funding among school districts and implementing some of the toughest accountability standards in the United States. Of the legislature\'s actions, Combs opined ""Kentucky has now, by reason of this legislation, decided to become educated—and we have embarked on a crusade for that purpose. Don\'t be surprised if we should within the next decade develop a first class, world-wide educational system.""[76]']"

Conant obtained a Ph.D. in chemistry from Harvard in 1916.', 'In 1933, Conant became the President of Harvard University with a reformist agenda that involved dispensing with a number of customs, including class rankings and the requirement for Latin classes. He abolished athletic scholarships, and instituted an ""up or out"" policy, under which untenured faculty who were not promoted were terminated. His egalitarian vision of education required a diversified student body, and he promoted the adoption of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and co-educational classes. During his presidency, women were admitted to Harvard Medical School and Harvard Law School for the first time.', 'Conant was appointed to the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) in 1940, becoming its chairman in 1941. In this capacity, he oversaw vital wartime research projects, including the development of synthetic rubber and the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bombs.  On July 16, 1945, he was among the dignitaries present at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range for the Trinity nuclear test, the first detonation of an atomic bomb, and was part of the Interim Committee that advised President Harry S. Truman to use atomic bombs on Japan. After the war, he served on the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDC) that was established to coordinate burgeoning defense research, and on the influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC); in the latter capacity he advised the president against starting a development program for the hydrogen bomb.', 'In his later years at Harvard, Conant taught undergraduate courses on the history and philosophy of science, and wrote books explaining the scientific method to laymen. In 1953, he retired as President of Harvard University and became the United States High Commissioner for Germany, overseeing the restoration of German sovereignty after World War II, and then was Ambassador to West Germany until 1957.', 'On returning to the United States, Conant criticized the education system in The American High School Today (1959), Slums and Suburbs (1961), and The Education of American Teachers (1963). Between 1965 and 1969, Conant authored his autobiography, My Several Lives (1970). He became increasingly infirm, had a series of strokes in 1977, and died in a nursing home in Hanover, New Hampshire, the following year.', 'Conant became an associate professor in 1924.[13][14] In 1925, he visited Germany, then the heart of chemical research,[15] for eight months. He toured the major universities and laboratories there and met many of the leading chemists, including Theodor Curtius, Kazimierz Fajans, Hans Fischer, Arthur Hantzsch, Hans Meerwein, Jakob Meisenheimer, Hermann Staudinger, Adolf Windaus and Karl Ziegler. After Conant returned to the United States, Arthur Amos Noyes made him an attractive offer to move to Caltech. The President of Harvard, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, made a counter offer: immediate promotion to professor, effective September 1, 1927, with a salary of $7,000 (roughly equivalent to US$122,782 as of 2024[16]) and a grant of $9,000 per annum for research. Conant accepted and stayed at Harvard.[17] In 1929, he became the Sheldon Emery Professor of Organic Chemistry, and then, in 1931, the chairman of the chemistry department.[13]', 'After some months of lobbying and discussion, Harvard\'s ruling body, the Harvard Corporation, announced on May 8, 1933, that it had elected Conant as the next President of Harvard.[53] Alfred North Whitehead, Harvard\'s eminent professor of philosophy disagreed with the decision, declaring, ""The Corporation should not have elected a chemist to the Presidency."" ""But,"" Corporation member Grenville Clark reminded him, ""Eliot was a chemist, and our best president too."" ""I know,"" replied Whitehead, ""but Eliot was a bad chemist.""[54] Clark was very much responsible for Conant\'s election.[55]', ""On October 9, 1933, Conant became the President of Harvard University with a low-key installation ceremony in the Faculty Room of University Hall.[56][57] This set the tone for Conant's presidency as one of informality and reform. At his inauguration, he accepted the charter and seal presented to John Leverett the Younger in 1707, but dropped a number of other customs, including the singing of Gloria Patri and the Latin Oration.[58] While, unlike some other universities, Harvard did not require Greek or Latin for entrance, they were worth double credits towards admission, and students like Conant who had studied Latin were awarded an A.B. degree while those who had not, received an S.B. One of his first efforts at reform was to attempt to abolish this distinction.[59] But in 1937 he wrote:"", 'Conant asked two of his assistant deans, Henry Chauncey and William Bender, to determine whether the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was a good measure of academic potential. When they reported that it was, Conant adopted it.[69] He waged a ten-year campaign for the consolidation of testing services, which resulted in the creation of the Educational Testing Service in 1946, with Chauncey as its director.[70] Theodore H. White, a Boston Jewish ""meatball"" who received a personal letter of introduction from Conant so that he could report on the Chinese Civil War, noted that ""Conant was the first president to recognize that meatballs were Harvard men too.""[68]\nLowell, Conant\'s predecessor, had imposed a 15 percent quota on Jewish students in 1922, something Conant had voted to support.[71]', ""What Conant feared most was disruption to Harvard's tercentennial celebrations in 1936, but there was no trouble despite the presence of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and a Harvard graduate of the class of 1904, whom many fellow Harvard graduates regarded as a socialist and a class traitor.[95][96] Privately, Conant approved of the New Deal and expressed admiration for Roosevelt's goals. He invited Roosevelt to speak at the tercentennial celebrations.[96] This did not sit well with Lowell, and it was only with difficulty that Lowell was persuaded to be presiding officer at an event at which Roosevelt spoke.[97] The parallels between Roosevelt's New Deal and Conant's advocacy of meritocracy and of education as a means of social mobility did not escape notice.[98][99] Conant recognized that education in America contributed to social stratification rather than breaking it down, and that educational opportunity needed to be extended to areas where it was deficient, such as rural areas, small towns and inner cities. He advocated for federal interventions, since these areas were often poor and lacking in the funds needed to improve education, and that they were economically and socially stratified with political and taxation structures that reinforced social stratification.[100]"", ""In August 1942, Roosevelt appointed Conant to the Rubber Survey Committee. Chaired by Bernard M. Baruch,  a trusted adviser and confidant of Roosevelt, the committee was tasked with reviewing the synthetic rubber program.[127] Corporations used patent laws to restrict competition and stifle innovation.[128] When the Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak, followed by the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, cut off 90 percent of the supply of natural rubber,[127]  the rubber shortage became a national scandal,[129] and the development of synthetic substitutes, an urgent priority.[127] Baruch dealt with the difficult political issues;[130] Conant concerned himself with the technical ones. There were a number of different synthetic rubber products to choose from. In addition to DuPont's neoprene, Standard Oil had licensed German patents for a copolymer called Buna-N and a related product, Buna-S. None had been manufactured on the scale now required, and there was pressure from agricultural interests to choose a process which involved making raw materials from farm products.[131] The Rubber Survey Committee made a series of recommendations, including the appointment of a rubber director, and the construction and operation of 51 factories to supply the materials needed for synthetic rubber production.[127] Technical problems dogged the program through 1943, but by late 1944 plants were in operation with an annual capacity of over a million tons, most of which was Buna-S.[132]"", 'By September 1948, the Red Scare began to take hold, and Conant called for a ban on hiring teachers who were communists, although not for the dismissal of those who had already been hired. A debate ensued over whether communist educators could teach apolitical subjects.[141] Conant was a member of the Educational Policies Commission (EPC), a body to which he had been appointed in 1941.[142] When it next met in March 1949, Conant\'s push for a ban was supported by the president of Columbia University, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower. The two found common ground in their belief in ideology-based education,[143] which Conant called ""democratic education"". He did not see public education as a side effect of American democracy, but as one of its principal driving forces,[144] and he disapproved of the public funding of denominational schools that he observed in Australia during his visit there in 1951.[145] He called for increased federal spending on education, and higher taxes to redistribute wealth.[144] His thinking was outlined in his books Education in a Divided World in 1948,[146] and Education and Liberty in 1951.[147] In 1952, he went further and endorsed the dismissal of academics who invoked the Fifth under questioning by the House Un-American Activities Committee.[148]', 'A sign of Conant\'s declining influence occurred in 1950, when he was passed over for the post of President of the National Academy of Sciences in favor of Detlev Bronk, the president of Johns Hopkins University, after a ""revolt"" by scientists unhappy with Conant.[149] The GAC was enormously influential throughout the late 1940s, but the opposition of Oppenheimer and Conant to the development of the hydrogen bomb, only to be overridden by Truman in 1950, diminished its stature.[150] It was reduced further when Oppenheimer and Conant were not reappointed when their terms expired in 1952,  depriving the GAC of its two best-known members.[151] Conant was appointed to the National Science Board, which administered the new National Science Foundation, and was elected its chairman, but this body had little financial or political clout.[152] In April 1951, Truman appointed Conant to the Science Advisory Committee, but it would not develop into an influential body until the Eisenhower administration.[153]', 'His subsequent Slums and Suburbs in 1961 was far more controversial in its treatment of racial issues. Regarding busing as impractical, Conant urged Americans ""to accept de facto segregated schools"".[173][174] This did not go over well with civil rights groups, and by 1964 Conant was forced to admit that he had been wrong.[173] In The Education of American Teachers in 1963, Conant found much to criticize about the training of teachers. Most controversial was his defense of the arrangement by which teachers were certified by independent bodies rather than the teacher training colleges.[172]', ""On December 6, 1963, President Lyndon Johnson presented Conant with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with special distinction. He was selected for the award by President John F. Kennedy, but the ceremony was delayed prior to Kennedy's assassination.[175]"", ""In February 1970, President Richard Nixon  presented Conant with the Atomic Pioneers Award from the Atomic Energy Commission.[176] Other awards that Conant received during his long career included being made a Commander of Légion d'honneur by France in 1936 and an Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Britain in 1948, and he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. He was also awarded over 50 honorary degrees,[177] and was posthumously inducted into the Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame in 2000.[6]"", 'Between 1965 and 1969, Conant, living with a heart condition, worked on his biography, My Several Lives.[178] He became increasingly infirm, and had a series of strokes in 1977.[179] He died in a nursing home in Hanover, New Hampshire, on February 11, 1978.[180] His body was cremated and his ashes interred in the Thayer-Richards family plot at Mount Auburn Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and sons. His papers are in the Harvard University Archives.[181] Among them was a sealed brown Manila envelope that Conant had given the archives in 1951, with instructions that it was to be opened by the President of Harvard in the 21st century. Opened by Harvard\'s 28th president, Drew Faust, in 2007, it contained a letter in which Conant expressed his hopes and fears for the future. ""You will\xa0... be in charge of a more prosperous and significant institution than the one over which I have the honor to preside"", he wrote. ""That [Harvard] will maintain the traditions of academic freedom, of tolerance for heresy, I feel sure.""[182]']"

He played 18 Test matches for the West Indies before the Second World War and took the team's first wicket in Test cricket.

He was knighted in 1962 and made a life peer in 1969."", 'Born in Trinidad, Constantine established an early reputation as a promising cricketer, and was a member of the West Indies teams that toured England in 1923 and 1928. Unhappy at the lack of opportunities for black people in Trinidad, he decided to pursue a career as a professional cricketer in England, and during the 1928 tour was awarded a contract with the Lancashire League club Nelson. He played for the club with  distinction between 1929 and 1938, while continuing as a member of the West Indies Test team in tours of England and Australia. Although his record as a Test cricketer was less impressive than in other cricket, he helped to establish a uniquely West Indian style of play. He was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1939.', 'From 1961 to 1964, he served as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and, controversially, became involved in issues relating to racial discrimination, including the Bristol Bus Boycott. In his final years, he served on the Race Relations Board, the Sports Council and the Board of Governors of the BBC. Failing health reduced his effectiveness in some of these roles, and he faced criticism for becoming a part of the British Establishment. He died of a heart attack on 1 July 1971, aged 69. In June 2021, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame as one of the special inductees to mark the inaugural edition of the ICC World Test Championship final.[1][2]', 'Although racial discrimination continued to persist in Britain, this case was the first to challenge such practices in court. Critics regard it as a milestone in British racial equality in demonstrating that black people had legal recourse against some forms of racism.[175] According to Mason, it ""was one of the key milestones along the road to the creation of the Race Relations Act of 1965.""[176]', 'In April 1963, when a Bristol bus company was refusing to employ black staff, Constantine visited the city and spoke to the press about the issue. His intervention assisted in a speedy resolution of the affair which, according to Mason, was crucial in persuading the British government of the need for a Race Relations Act.[215] However, politicians in both Trinidad and Tobago and Britain felt a senior diplomat should not be so closely involved in British domestic affairs, particularly as he acted without consulting his government. Williams effectively withdrew his support from Constantine, who decided not to continue as High Commissioner when his term expired in February 1964.[216][217] He was succeeded by Wilfred Andrew Rose.[218]', ""In 1965, he became a founding member of the Sports Council, which aimed to develop sport in Britain. Two years later, he was appointed to the three-person Race Relations Board, formed through the Race Relations Act, to investigate cases of racial discrimination.[223] In this role he spoke out against the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, a stance that led to an offer from the Liberal Party, which he declined, to stand as parliamentary candidate for the Nelson and Colne constituency.[224] Later, he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate the release, after a military coup, of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the overthrown Prime Minister of Nigeria.[225] Constantine was appointed to the BBC's General Advisory Committee in 1966 and became a BBC Governor two years later, although declining health restricted his involvement.[3][226] The following year the students of St Andrews University elected Constantine as Rector, but again his health prevented him performing effectively in this role.[227]""]"

On June 30, 1924, Calvin Jr. had played tennis with his brother on the White House tennis courts without putting on socks and developed a blister on one of his toes. The blister subsequently degenerated into sepsis. Calvin Jr. died a little over a week later at the age of 16.[23] The President never forgave himself for Calvin Jr\'s death.[24] His eldest son John said it ""hurt [Coolidge] terribly"", and psychiatric biographer Robert E. Gilbert, author of The Tormented President: Calvin Coolidge, Death, and Clinical Depression, said that Coolidge ""ceased to function as President after the death of his sixteen-year-old son"". Gilbert explains in his book how Coolidge displayed all ten of the symptoms listed by the American Psychiatric Association as evidence of major depressive disorder following Calvin Jr.\'s sudden death.[25] John later became a railroad executive, helped to start the Coolidge Foundation, and was instrumental in creating the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site.[26]', ""Coolidge's speech was well received, and he attracted some admirers on its account;[49] towards the end of the term, many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected unanimously to be President of the Senate.[50] Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus Frank Stearns, encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor.[51] Stearns, an executive with the Boston department store R. H. Stearns, became another key ally, and began a publicity campaign on Coolidge's behalf before he announced his candidacy at the end of the 1915 legislative session.[52]"", ""Coolidge was unopposed for the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, ran on the previous administration's record: fiscal conservatism, a vague opposition to Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in World War I.[2] The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among Irish and German Americans.[58] Coolidge was elected by a margin of 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns.[59]"", 'The U.S. vice-presidency did not carry many official duties, but Coolidge was invited by President Harding to attend cabinet meetings, making him the first vice president to do so.[84] He gave a number of unremarkable speeches around the country.[85]', 'As vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace were invited to quite a few parties, where the legend of ""Silent Cal"" was born. It is from this time that most of the jokes and anecdotes involving Coolidge originate, such as Coolidge being ""silent in five languages"".[86] Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private he was a man of few words and was commonly referred to as ""Silent Cal"". An apocryphal story has it that a person seated next to him at a dinner said to him, ""I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you."" He replied, ""You lose.""[87] However, on April 22, 1924, Coolidge himself said that the ""You lose"" quotation never occurred. The story about it was related by Frank B. Noyes, President of the Associated Press, to their membership at their annual luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, when toasting and introducing Coolidge, who was the invited speaker. After the introduction and before his prepared remarks, Coolidge said to the membership, ""Your President [referring to Noyes] has given you a perfect example of one of those rumors now current in Washington which is without any foundation.""[88]', 'As president, Coolidge\'s reputation as a quiet man continued. ""The words of a President have an enormous weight,"" he would later write, ""and ought not to be used indiscriminately.""[92] Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. ""I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President,"" he once told Ethel Barrymore, ""and I think I will go along with them.""[93] Some historians suggest that Coolidge\'s image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic,[94] while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening after the death of his son in 1924.[95] Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, ""How can they tell?""[96]', ""On August 2, 1923, President Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack in San Francisco while on a speaking tour of the western United States.

Did he support these measures while president? No, because in the 1920s, such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local governments.""[120][121] However, Coolidge did sign the Radio Act of 1927 into law that established the Federal Radio Commission (1927–1934), the equal-time rule for radio broadcasters in the United States, and restricted radio broadcasting licenses to stations that demonstrated that they served ""the public interest, convenience, or necessity"".[122][123]', ""Although a few of Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge initially retained all of them, out of an ardent conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until the next election. He kept Harding's able speechwriter Judson T. Welliver; Stuart Crawford replaced Welliver in November 1925.[167] Coolidge appointed C. Bascom Slemp, a Virginia Congressman and experienced federal politician, to work jointly with Edward T. Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as Secretaries to the President (a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff).[105]"", ""Coolidge appointed one justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, Harlan F. Stone in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, Harry M. Daugherty.[172] It does not appear that Coolidge considered appointing anyone other than Stone, although Stone himself had urged Coolidge to appoint Benjamin N. Cardozo.[173] Stone proved to be a firm believer in judicial restraint and was regarded as one of the court's three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation.[174] President Franklin D. Roosevelt later appointed Stone to be chief justice."", 'In the summer of 1927, Coolidge vacationed in the Black Hills of South Dakota. While on vacation, Coolidge surprisingly issued a terse statement that he would not seek a second full term as president: ""I do not choose to run for President in 1928.""[176] After allowing the reporters to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. ""If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933\xa0… Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it\xa0– too long!""[177] In his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: ""The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish.""[178] After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 with a landslide by Herbert Hoover. Coolidge had been reluctant to endorse Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that ""for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice\xa0– all of it bad.""[179] Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the nomination of the popular commerce secretary.[180]', 'Despite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available to reporters, giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before or since.[188] Coolidge\'s second inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, his speech to Congress was broadcast on radio,[189] the first presidential radio address.[190] Coolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created Federal Radio Commission. On August 11, 1924, Theodore W. Case, using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process he developed for Lee de Forest, filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making ""Silent Cal"" the first president to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds.[191][192] When Charles Lindbergh arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and presented him with the Medal of Honor;[193] the event was captured on film.[194]']"

The Hangover was a commercial success and finished as among the highest-grossing R-rated films in the United States.[47] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, ""Mr. Cooper\xa0... offers the most interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss.""[48] For his performance Cooper received an award at the 13th Hollywood Film Festival and his first nomination for MTV Movie Awards (Best Comedic Performance).[49][50] The Daily Telegraph opined that the film\'s success turned Cooper into ""a bona fide leading man"".[8] Nevertheless, Cooper stated in a 2011 interview with Shave: ""It\'s the same. I mean, look, more doors have been opened for sure, but it\'s not like I sit back with a cigar on Monday morning and go through the scripts that have been offered.""[51]', 'In 2011, Cooper starred in the techno-thriller Limitless, based on the 2001 novel The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn. In the Neil Burger-directed film, he played a struggling writer who is introduced to a nootropic drug that gives him the ability to fully utilize his brain and vastly improve his lifestyle.[64] The box office website Box Office Mojo was apprehensive of the film\'s financial prospects, but it emerged as a commercial success with a worldwide gross of $161\xa0million.[65][66] A writer for Variety said of Cooper\'s performance that he ""makes further strides toward major stardom, spelling excellent early spring returns and socko vid play"".[67] Greater commercial success followed with the comedy sequel The Hangover Part\xa0II (2011), which earned over $580\xa0million worldwide.[68] Reviews for the film were generally negative,[69] but Mary Pols of Time magazine complimented Cooper, writing that the actor ""gives a knowing performance: he\'s both the peacock and the parody of one. He\'s blessed with good looks and fantastic timing, the kind that makes every line funnier, even the small asides.""[70] At the 38th People\'s Choice Awards, he was nominated for Favorite Comedic Movie Actor.[71]', 'None of Cooper\'s films released in 2015\xa0– Aloha, Burnt, or Joy\xa0– fared well at the box office.[87] He starred in Cameron Crowe\'s Aloha with Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams.[110] The project was the subject of controversy after the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans accused the filmmakers of whitewashing the cast.[111] Despite the backlash, he was nominated for Choice Movie Actor\xa0– Comedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards.[112] In John Wells\' drama Burnt, Cooper played a chef who decides to regain his former glory after drug abuse takes a toll on his career. While the film was criticized for its ""overdone clichés"",[113] Jon Frosch of The Hollywood Reporter said: ""[Cooper] gives a fully engaged performance that almost makes us want to forgive the movie\'s laziness. Almost.""[114] His supporting role in the biopic Joy reunited him with David O. Russell and Lawrence.[115] In 2016, he had a voice cameo in the thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane, and played a supporting part in War Dogs, co-produced under his and Todd Phillips\'s production company Joint Effort.[116][117] In 2017, Cooper again voiced Rocket Raccoon, in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.[118]', 'After reprising the role of Rocket Raccoon in Avengers: Infinity War (2018),[119] Cooper directed his first film, A Star Is Born, a remake of the 1937 film of same name. Cooper starred in the film as an established singer, Jackson Maine, whose romance with a woman named Ally (played by Lady Gaga) becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his.[120] Having long aspired to direct a film, Cooper was keen on making a love story. People had warned him against directing a third remake, and he feared the film would end his directing career if it failed.[121] The film premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival in August 2018, and was released worldwide in October to critical acclaim.[122][123] On Cooper\'s direction, Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote that ""to say that [Cooper] does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment"" and that he ""gets right onto the high wire"".[124] Brian Tallerico, writing for RogerEbert.com, said Cooper ""does some of the best work of his career"" and gives ""an excellent performance"", praising his singing abilities and chemistry with Gaga.[125] The film earned over $436\xa0million at the box office against a production budget of $36\xa0million.[126]', 'Cooper spent nearly four years working on the project, including spending five days a week taking voice, piano, and guitar lessons for six months in preparation for the role.[127][128] He and Gaga co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the soundtrack for A Star Is Born, which she insisted they record live. Cooper undertook vocal training for 18 months to prepare, including with the help of vocal coach Roger Love.[129][130] The album contains elements of blues rock, country and bubblegum pop.[131] Billboard says its lyrics are about wanting change, its struggle, love, romance, and bonding, describing the music as ""timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like songs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit to the core of the listener.""[132] The album\'s release coincided with the film\'s, and it contains 34 tracks, including 19 original songs. It received generally positive reviews from critics;[133] Mark Kennedy of The Washington Post called it a ""five-star marvel"" and Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian termed it an ""instant classics full of Gaga\'s emotional might"".[131][134] Commercially, the soundtrack reached number one in the US, Ireland and the UK.[135] The record\'s lead single, ""Shallow"", was released that September[136] and reached number one in the US, Australia, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK.[137]', 'For the film, Cooper received a National Board of Review Award for Best Director and two Golden Globe nominations, for Best Actor in a Drama and Best Director.[138][139] Cooper earned two Grammy nominations for ""Shallow"": Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (winning the latter).

As a result, Cooper became the first person with five nominations in a single ceremony in BAFTA\'s history.[141] Cooper was also nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay.[142] He later remarked that he was ""embarrassed"" by his failure to gain a directing nomination at the ceremony.[143]', 'For the film, Cooper received a National Board of Review Award for Best Director and two Golden Globe nominations, for Best Actor in a Drama and Best Director.[138][139] Cooper earned two Grammy nominations for ""Shallow"": Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (winning the latter).

It led Jackson Weaver of CBC News to term Cooper ""one of the few genuinely talented live actor turned voice actors"".[159] Cooper next directed, produced and co-wrote Maestro (2023), a biographical drama about the relationship between composer Leonard Bernstein and his wife Felicia Montealegre, in which he also portrayed Bernstein opposite Carey Mulligan\'s Montealegre.[160] He was hired by filmmaker Steven Spielberg to direct the project after a screening of A Star is Born.[161] Controversy arose over Cooper\'s use of a prosthetic nose to play Bernstein, which some considered an example of ""Jewface"".[162] Cooper was defended by both Bernstein\'s children and the Anti-Defamation League.[163][164] Reviewing the film for BBC Culture, Nicholas Barber wrote, ""Maestro confirms what was suggested by Cooper\'s directorial debut, A Star Is Born.

He died in a Washington, D.C., retirement home on February 21, 1991, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery."", 'John Sherman Cooper was born August 23, 1901, in Somerset, Kentucky.[1] He was the second child and first son of seven children born to John Sherman and Helen Gertrude (Tartar) Cooper.[2] The Cooper family had been prominent in the Somerset area since brothers Malachi and Edward Cooper migrated from South Carolina along the Wilderness Trail and through the Cumberland Gap around 1790, shortly after Daniel Boone.[3] His father\'s parents\xa0– staunch Baptists\xa0– were active in the anti-slavery movement in the nineteenth century, and the elder John Sherman Cooper (called ""Sherman"") was named after the Apostle John and William Tecumseh Sherman, a hero of the Union in the Civil War.[4] The family was very active in local politics; six of Cooper\'s ancestors, including his father, were elected county judges in Pulaski County, and two had been circuit judges.[5] Sherman Cooper engaged in numerous successful business ventures and was known as the wealthiest man in Somerset.[6][7] At the time of John Sherman Cooper\'s birth, his father was serving as collector of internal revenue in Kentucky\'s 8th congressional district, a position to which he had been appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt.[8]', ""Although well above the draft age at 41 years old, Cooper enlisted for service in the United States Army in World War II in 1942.[1] Immediately offered an officer's commission, he chose instead to enlist as a private.[20] After basic training, he enrolled in Officer Candidate School at the Fort Custer Training Center in Michigan.[9] He studied military government and graduated second in his class of 111 students.[6][21] In 1943, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the XV Corps of General George Patton's Third Army as a courier in the military police.[22] Cooper served in France, Luxembourg, and Germany.[12] After liberating the Buchenwald concentration camp, Patton ordered the entire population of the nearby city of Weimar to go through it and observe the conditions; Cooper also viewed the camp at that time.[23]"", ""Following the cessation of hostilities, Cooper served as a legal advisor for the 300,000 displaced persons in his unit's occupation zone seeking repatriation after being brought to Germany as slaves by the Nazis.[9] Under the terms of the agreement reached at the Yalta Conference, all displaced Russian nationals were to be returned to the Soviet Union, but Soviet negotiators decided that the agreement did not apply to non-Russian spouses and children of the nationals.[9] Cooper brought this to the attention of General Patton, who rescinded the repatriation order in the Third Army's occupation zone.[9] Cooper received a citation from the Third Army's military government section for his action.[24] Cooper also oversaw the reorganization of the 239 courts in the German state of Bavaria in an attempt to replace all the Nazi officials, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal.[9] Among the judges installed by Cooper were Wilhelm Hoegner, future Minister-President of Bavaria, and Ludwig Erhard, the future Chancellor of Germany.[25]"", 'A few days after being sworn in, Cooper co-sponsored his first piece of legislation, a bill to provide federal aid for education.[9] The bill passed the Senate, but not the House.[9] Cooper was made chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads, and helped draft a bill authorizing $900\xa0million in federal funds to states for highway construction.[9] In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity.[12] He insisted on an amendment to the War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets.[9] He also co-sponsored legislation allowing hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally.[9] He opposed bans on industrywide collective bargaining for organized labor and on the establishment of closed shops.[9] He voted against putting union welfare funds under government control, but helped to pass an amendment forbidding compulsory union membership for workers.[9]', ""Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the practice of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers.[12] In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly.[9] He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951.[12] Secretary of State Dean Acheson chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and Brussels in December 1950.[36] Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley's elevation to the vice-presidency.[37] Speculation was raised that Clements, who won Barkley's old seat in a special election in 1950, may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments.[37]"", ""Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the practice of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers.[12] In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations (U.N.)

Underwood, Governor Lawrence Wetherby's appointee to fill the vacancy.[37] Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race. Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democrat Truman.[38] Both the Louisville Times and the Louisville Courier-Journal recanted their statements in 1950 for Cooper to seek election to the Senate in 1954. They now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued US involvement in the Korean War.[39] Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by 29,000 votes in the election and served out the remainder of Chapman's term.[40] His victory marked the first time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once.[41]"", 'Cooper again sought re-election in 1954.[12] Democrats first considered Governor Wetherby as his opponent, but Wetherby\'s candidacy would have drawn a primary challenger from the Happy Chandler faction of the Democratic Party, possibly leading to a party split and Cooper\'s re-election.[47] Instead, party leaders convinced former Vice President Barkley, now 77 years old, to run for the seat in order to ensure party unity.[47] There were few policy differences between Barkley and Cooper, who had been deemed the most liberal Republican in the Senate by Americans for Democratic Action.[47][48] During the campaign, Cooper was featured on the cover of Time on July 5, 1954.[9] Cooper appealed to women voters, as well as black voters who appreciated his support for civil rights.[49] He also claimed that he would be a less partisan senator than Barkley.[50] Barkley\'s personal popularity carried him to a 71,000-vote victory, however.[47] Glenn Finch opined that ""Barkley was unbeatable in his own state, and it is probable that no other candidate could have defeated Cooper.""[47]', ""In 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower nominated Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal.[12] During his time as a delegate for the United Nations, Cooper had met Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and established a cordial working relationship with the Indian delegation, including Nehru's sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.[51] The Indians had been impressed with Cooper and the Indian government had expressed their desire that Cooper serve as their ambassador from the U.S.[51] Cooper initially rejected the position offered by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles but was convinced to accept it by a personal request from President Eisenhower.[51]"", ""In 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower nominated Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal.[12] During his time as a delegate for the United Nations, Cooper had met Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and established a cordial working relationship with the Indian delegation, including Nehru's sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.[51] The Indians had been impressed with Cooper and the Indian government had expressed their desire that Cooper serve as their ambassador from the U.S.[51] Cooper initially rejected the position offered by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles but was convinced to accept it by a personal request from President Eisenhower.[51]"", 'The Dulles–Cuhna communique touched off anti-American demonstrations in many parts of India.[62] On December 6, Dulles held a news conference during which he reaffirmed U.S. neutrality on the Goa issue, but did not recant claims of Portuguese sovereignty over the region.[64] Prime Minister Nehru announced his intent to file a formal protest with the United States over the communique and to address the Indian Parliament about the matter.[65] In the interim, Cooper secured a meeting with Nehru and forestalled both actions.[66] Cooper became even more upset with Dulles when Dulles authorized withholding $10\xa0million of a $50\xa0million aid package to India; Cooper protested the withholding, and Dulles decided to pay the full amount.[67]', ""Throughout the early part of 1956, Cooper strongly advocated that the U.S. respect Indian nonalignment and increase economic aid to the country.[68] In August 1956, Congress approved a financial aid package for India that included the largest sale up to that point of surplus agricultural products by the United States to any country.[69] Cooper's persistence in requesting such aid was critical in getting the package approved, as it was opposed by many administration officials, including Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover Jr., Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey, and International Cooperation Administration Director John B. Hollister.[69]"", ""Senator Barkley died in office on April 30, 1956.[70] Republican leaders encouraged Cooper to return from India and seek the seat, but Cooper was reluctant to give up his ambassadorship.[70] After a personal appeal from President Eisenhower, however, Cooper acquiesced and declared his candidacy in July 1956.[70] Even after leaving India, he maintained close ties with the country's leaders and was the official U.S. representative at the funerals of Prime Minister Nehru in 1964, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1966, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984.[9]"", 'President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission, which was charged with investigating Kennedy\'s assassination in 1963.[12] Cooper attended 50 of the 94 hearings and rejected the single-bullet theory stating that ""there was no evidence to show that [Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally] were hit by the same bullet.""[79] Cooper publicly criticized the report\'s conclusions as ""premature and inconclusive"", and informed Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy that he strongly felt Lee Harvey Oswald had not acted alone. When Cooper expressed his same thoughts to Jacqueline Kennedy, he reportedly stated that ""it\'s important for this nation that we bring the true murderers to justice.""[80]', 'As one of three Republicans on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, Cooper was involved with the investigation of Johnson aide Bobby Baker in 1964, which he decried as ""a whitewash"" after the committee blocked further investigation.[73] He proposed the establishment of a Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct in July 1964 and was named to that committee in July 1965.[73] Also in 1965, he was chosen advisor to the United States delegation to the Manila Conference that established the Asian Development Bank.[13]', 'An advocate for small businesses and agricultural interests, Cooper opposed an April 1965 bill that expanded the powers of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate cigarette advertising.[73] In March 1966, he proposed an amendment to a mine safety bill supported by the United Mine Workers of America that would have nullified provisions of the bill if they were not shown to contribute to the safety of small mines, but his amendment was defeated.[73]', ""Although Cooper voted in favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed escalating U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.[92] As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia.[93] He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale.[94] On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations.[95] Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.[96]"", 'In January 1966, Cooper accompanied Secretary of State Rusk and Ambassador W. Averell Harriman on an official visit to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos as part of a widely publicized ""peace drive"".[73] This visit, along with visits to South Vietnam in December 1965 and January 1966, reinforced Cooper\'s opposition to military operations in Southeast Asia.[97] In a meeting with President Johnson on January 26, 1966, he again urged the president to forgo his announced intentions to resume bombing missions in North Vietnam and negotiate a settlement instead.[97] Johnson was noncommittal, and that afternoon, Cooper returned to the Senate floor, urgently trying to convince the legislators that negotiation was preferable to escalation, even when it meant negotiating with the Viet Cong fighters in South Vietnam, which he believed was necessary to achieve peace.[98] Cooper advocated a three-to-five-year cease fire, enforced by the United Nations, followed by national elections as prescribed by the 1954 Geneva Convention.[98] Ultimately, Johnson did not heed Cooper\'s plea and resumed U.S. bombing missions in North Vietnam.[99]', 'In January 1966, Cooper accompanied Secretary of State Rusk and Ambassador W.

General Assembly in 1968, Cooper strongly denounced the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.[103] He also supported Montana Senator Mike Mansfield's proposal to bring the matter of the Vietnam War before the United Nations.[73] Returning to the Senate in 1969, he joined Alaska Senator Ernest Gruening and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse in protesting restrictions on orderly protests at the United States Capitol.[73]"", 'In the Senate, Cooper helped lead the opposition to the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), putting him at odds with many in his party, including President Nixon.[102] Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race.[102] On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50–51; Vice President Spiro Agnew cast the tie-breaking vote.[102] After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator Philip Hart co-sponsored the Cooper–Hart Amendment that would have allowed funding for research and development of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system.[9] The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the Defense Department budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets.[104] Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.[9]', 'Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-sponsored the Cooper–Church Amendments, aimed at curbing further escalation of the Vietnam War.[105] Congressional approval of one of these amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand.[106] Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended.[106] When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, Cambodia\'s new leader, Lon Nol, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule.[106] Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region.[106] Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58–37.[107] The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect.[108] The amendment was nevertheless hailed by The Washington Post as ""the first time in our history that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war.""[108] The fight over the Cooper–Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper\'s health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength.[108] In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.[108]', 'Seventy-one years of age and becoming increasingly deaf, Cooper announced to the Kentucky Press Association on January 21, 1972, that he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat,[109] having served longer in that body than any other Kentuckian except Alben Barkley.[27] The lame duck Cooper decided to make one more attempt to end the war, after an aggressive North Vietnamese offensive against the South in March 1972 intensified fighting in the region once again.[110] Without advance notice, Cooper addressed a nearly empty Senate chamber on July 27, 1972, proposing an amendment to a military assistance bill that would unconditionally end funding for all U.S. military operations in Indochina in four months.[110] The measure, which had no co-sponsors, stunned Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and provoked heated debate in the Senate.[110] Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke saved the amendment from almost certain demise by adding a provision that all American prisoners of war be returned prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces.[110] The revised amendment passed 62–33, whereupon Nixon decided to sacrifice the entire military assistance bill.[110] At Nixon\'s insistence, the Senate defeated the amended bill 48–42.[111] Disappointed, Cooper nevertheless proclaimed, ""I feel purged inside. I\'ve felt strongly about this for a long time. Now it\'s in the hands of the President. He\'s the only person who can do anything about ending the war now.""[111]']"

E. R. Watt's Biographical Dictionary of Scottish  Graduates to A.D. 1410 (1977).[8] James Hutchison Cockburn, in his Medieval Bishop of Dunblane and their Church (1959) devoted seven less extensively sourced pages, but they emphasized the analysis of a few events during de Coventre's episcopate, and the events of his time.[9]"", 'There is no direct evidence of de Coventre\'s family, but two other men bearing the name ""de Coventre"" are known to have been active during Walter\'s lifetime.

Before December 1341, when he resigned, John de Coventre held the parish church of Inverarity, Angus, in the diocese of St Andrews.[15] On 7 December 1345, a William de Coventre, also from the diocese of Dunblane, held a canonry and prebends (a cathedral priesthood with stipends) in the diocese of Ross and the Collegiate Church of Abernethy, when he was granted the church of Inverarity that had previously been held by John de Coventre.

These details are also recorded in a papal letter to the Bishop of St Andrews in 1373:', 'Recently a petition of the secular Prior and Chapter [of Abernethy] for confirmation described how the [Collegiate] Church was founded by lay patrons for a prior and five canons. At a later date some of the patrons were eager to augment its rents, and the number of canons was hopefully raised to ten.

He helped build the case for the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the Holy See. Along with Thomas Cromwell, he supported the principle of royal supremacy, in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm."", ""During Cranmer's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed Church of England. Under Henry's rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church, due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers. He published the first officially authorised vernacular service, the Exhortation and Litany."", 'When Edward came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote major reforms. He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the Book of Common Prayer, a complete liturgy for the English Church. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the Eucharist, clerical celibacy, the role of images in places of worship, and the veneration of saints. Cranmer promulgated the new doctrines through the prayer book, the Homilies and other publications.', ""After the accession of the Catholic Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and heresy. Imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several recantations and apparently reconciled himself with the Catholic Church. While this would have normally absolved him, Mary wanted him executed, and he was burned at the stake on 21 March 1556; on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a heretic to Catholics and a martyr for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles, an Anglican statement of faith derived from his work."", 'Cranmer was born in 1489 at Aslockton in Nottinghamshire, England.[4] He was a younger son of Thomas Cranmer by his wife Agnes Hatfield. Thomas Cranmer was of modest wealth but was from a well-established armigerous gentry family which took its name from the manor of Cranmer in Lincolnshire.[5] A ledger stone to one of his relatives in the Church of St John of Beverley, Whatton, near Aslockton is inscribed as follows: Hic jacet Thomas Cranmer, Armiger, qui obiit vicesimo septimo die mensis Maii, anno d(omi)ni. MD centesimo primo, cui(us) a(n)i(ma)e p(ro)p(i)cietur Deus Amen (""here lies Thomas Cranmer, Esquire, who died on the 27th day of May in the year of our lord 1501, on whose soul may God look upon with mercy""). The arms of the Cranmer and Aslockton families are displayed. The figure is that of a man in flowing hair and gown, and a purse at his right side.[6] Their oldest son, John Cranmer, inherited the family estate, whereas Thomas and his younger brother Edmund were placed on the path to a clerical career.[7]', ""While Cranmer was following Charles through Italy, he received a royal letter dated 1 October 1532 informing him that he had been appointed the new Archbishop of Canterbury, following the death of archbishop William Warham. Cranmer was ordered to return to England. The appointment had been secured by the family of Anne Boleyn, who was being courted by Henry. When Cranmer's promotion became known in London, it caused great surprise as Cranmer had previously held only minor positions in the Church.[24] Cranmer left Mantua on 19 November and arrived in England at the beginning of January.[25] Henry personally financed the papal bulls necessary for Cranmer's promotion to Canterbury. The bulls were easily acquired because the papal nuncio was under orders from Rome to please the English in an effort to prevent a final breach. The bulls arrived around 26 March 1533 and Cranmer was consecrated as a bishop on 30 March in St Stephen's Chapel, by John Longland, Bishop of Lincoln; John Vesey, Bishop of Exeter; and Henry Standish, Bishop of St Asaph.[26] Even while they were waiting for the bulls, Cranmer continued to work on the annulment proceedings, which required greater urgency after Anne announced her pregnancy. Henry and Anne were secretly married on 24 or 25 January 1533 in the presence of a handful of witnesses.[27] Cranmer did not learn of the marriage until 14 days later.[28]"", 'The vicegerency brought the pace of reforms under the control of the king. A balance was instituted between the conservatives and the reformers and this was seen in the Ten Articles, the first attempt at defining the beliefs of the Henrician Church. The articles had a two-part structure. The first five articles showed the influence of the reformers by recognising only three of the former seven sacraments: baptism, eucharist, and penance. The last five articles concerned the roles of images, saints, rites and ceremonies, and purgatory, and they reflected the views of the traditionalists. Two early drafts of the document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work. The competition between the conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by Cranmer and Cuthbert Tunstall, the bishop of Durham. The end product had something that pleased and annoyed both sides of the debate.[44] By 11 July, Cranmer, Cromwell, and the Convocation, the general assembly of the clergy, had subscribed to the Ten Articles.[45]', ""In late 1536, the north of England was convulsed in a series of uprisings collectively known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, the most serious opposition to Henry's policies. Cromwell and Cranmer were the primary targets of the protesters' fury. Cromwell and the king worked furiously to quell the rebellion, while Cranmer kept a low profile.[46] After it was clear that Henry's regime was safe, the government took the initiative to remedy the evident inadequacy of the Ten Articles. The outcome after months of debate was The Institution of a Christian Man informally known from the first issue as the Bishops' Book. The book was initially proposed in February 1537 in the first vicegerential synod, ordered by Cromwell, for the whole Church. Cromwell opened the proceedings, but as the synod progressed, Cranmer and Foxe took on the chairmanship and the co-ordination. Foxe did most of the final editing and the book was published in late September.[47]"", ""Following the annulment, Cromwell was executed on 28 July.[55] Cranmer now found himself in a politically prominent position, with no one else to shoulder the burden.[56] Throughout the rest of Henry's reign, he clung to Henry's authority. The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the king.[57] At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, Catherine Howard, left for his first visit to the north of England. Cranmer was left in London as a member of a council taking care of matters for the king in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named John Lascelles revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry's return. Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on All Saints Day. An investigation revealed the truth of the marital indiscretions and Catherine was executed in February 1542.[58]"", ""With the atmosphere in Cranmer's favour, he pursued quiet efforts to reform the Church, particularly the liturgy. On 27 May 1544 the first officially authorised vernacular service was published, the processional service of intercession known as the Exhortation and Litany. It survives today with minor modifications in the Book of Common Prayer. The traditional litany uses invocations to saints, but Cranmer thoroughly reformed this aspect by providing no opportunity in the text for such veneration. Additional reformers were elected to the House of Commons and new legislation was introduced to curb the effects of the Act of the Six Articles and the Act for the Advancement of True Religion.[65]"", ""In 1546, the conservatives in a coalition including Gardiner, the Duke of Norfolk, the Lord Chancellor Wriothesley, and the bishop of London, Edmund Bonner, made one last attempt to challenge the reformers. Several reformers with links to Cranmer were targeted. Some such as Lascelles were burned at the stake. Powerful reform-minded nobles Edward Seymour and John Dudley returned to England from overseas and they were able to turn the tide against the conservatives. Two incidents tipped the balance. Gardiner was disgraced before the king when he refused to agree to exchange episcopal estates, and the son of the Duke of Norfolk was charged with treason and executed. There is no evidence that Cranmer played any part in these political games, and there were no further plots as the king's health ebbed in his final months. Cranmer performed his final duties for the king on 28 January 1547 when he gave a reformed statement of faith while gripping Henry's hand instead of giving him his last rites. Cranmer mourned Henry's death and it was later said that he demonstrated his grief by growing a beard. The beard was also a sign of his break with the past. Continental reformers grew beards to mark their rejection of the old Church and this significance of clerical beards was well understood in England. On 31 January, he was among the executors of the king's final will that nominated Edward Seymour as Lord Protector and welcomed the boy king, Edward VI.[66]"", 'As the use of English in worship services spread, the need for a complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the 1549 Book of Common Prayer were held in the former abbey of Chertsey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The list of participants can be only partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned the doctrine of the corporeal real presence and believed that the Eucharistic presence was only spiritual.[74] Parliament backed the publication of the prayer book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalized clerical marriage.[75]', ""The use of the new prayer book was made compulsory on 9 June 1549. This triggered a series of protests in Devon and Cornwall where the English language was not yet in common usage,[78] now known as the Prayer Book Rebellion. By early July, the uprising had spread to other parts in the east of England. The rebels made a number of demands including the restoration of the Six Articles, the use of Latin for the mass with only the consecrated bread given to the laity, the restoration of prayers for souls in purgatory, and the rebuilding of abbeys. Cranmer wrote a strong response to these demands to the King in which he denounced the wickedness of the rebellion.[79] On 21 July, Cranmer commandeered St Paul's Cathedral where he vigorously defended the official Church line. A draft of his sermon, the only extant written sample of his preaching from his entire career, shows that he collaborated with Peter Martyr on dealing with the rebellion.[80]"", 'The original Catholic canon law that defined governance within the Church clearly needed revision following Henry\'s break with Rome. Several revision attempts were made throughout Henry\'s reign, but these initial projects were shelved as the speed of reform outpaced the time required to work on a revision. As the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work. He recruited Peter Martyr to the committee and he also asked Łaski and Hooper to participate, showing his habitual ability to forgive past actions. Cranmer and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law-code in England would have international significance. Cranmer planned to draw together all the reformed churches of Europe under England\'s leadership to counter the Council of Trent, the Catholic Church\'s response to the Protestant Reformation. In March 1552, Cranmer invited the foremost Continental reformers, Bullinger, John Calvin, and Melanchthon to come to England and to participate in an ecumenical council.[90] The response was disappointing: Melanchthon did not respond, Bullinger stated that neither of them could leave Germany as it was riven by war between the Emperor and the Lutheran princes, and while Calvin showed some enthusiasm, he said he was unable to come. Cranmer acknowledged Calvin and replied stating, ""Meanwhile, we will reform the English Church to the utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after the model of holy scripture.""[88] One partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr. When the final version was presented to Parliament, the breach between Cranmer and Dudley was complete and the regent effectively killed the canon law bill in the House of Lords.[91]', ""In his final days, Cranmer's circumstances changed, which led to several recantations. On 11 December, he was taken out of Bocardo and placed in the house of the Dean of Christ Church. This new environment was very different from that of his two years in prison. He was in an academic community and treated as a guest. Approached by a Dominican friar, Juan de Villagarcía, he debated the issues of papal supremacy and purgatory. In his first four recantations, produced between the end of January and mid-February, Cranmer submitted himself to the authority of the king and queen and recognised the Pope as head of the Church. On 14 February 1556, he was degraded from holy orders and returned to Bocardo. He had conceded very little and Edmund Bonner was not satisfied with these admissions."", 'On 24 February, a writ was issued to the mayor of Oxford and the date of Cranmer\'s execution was set for 7 March. Two days after the writ was issued, a fifth statement, the first which could be called a true recantation, was issued. Cranmer repudiated all Lutheran and Zwinglian theology, fully accepted Catholic theology, including papal supremacy and transubstantiation, and stated that there was no salvation outside the Catholic Church. He announced his joy at returning to the Catholic faith, asked for and received sacramental absolution, and participated in the mass. Cranmer\'s burning was postponed and, under the normal practice of canon law, he should have been absolved. Mary, however, decided that no further postponement was possible. His last recantation was issued on 18 March. It was a sign of a broken man, a sweeping confession of sin.[103] Despite the stipulation in canon law that recanting heretics be reprieved, Mary was determined to make an example of Cranmer, arguing that ""his iniquity and obstinacy was so great against God and your Grace that your clemency and mercy could have no place with him"", and pressed ahead with his execution.[104]', 'Cranmer was told that he would be able to make a final recantation, but that this time it was to be in public during a service at the University Church. He wrote and submitted the speech in advance and it was published after his death. At the pulpit on the day of his execution, 21 March 1556, he opened with a prayer and an exhortation to obey the king and queen, but he ended his sermon totally unexpectedly, deviating from the prepared script. He renounced the recantations that he had written or signed with his own hand since his degradation and he stated that, in consequence, his hand would be punished by being burnt first. He then said, ""And as for the Pope, I refuse him, as Christ\'s enemy, and Antichrist with all his false doctrine.""[105] He was pulled from the pulpit and taken to where Latimer and Ridley had been burnt six months previously. As the flames drew around him, he fulfilled his promise by placing his right hand into the heart of the fire, calling it ""that unworthy hand"". His dying words were, ""Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.""[106]', ""The Marian government produced a pamphlet with all six recantations plus the text of the speech Cranmer was to have made in the University Church. His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, though what actually happened soon became common knowledge, undermining the effectiveness of Marian propaganda. Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer's recantations. The exiles' propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings. Eventually John Foxe put Cranmer's story to effective use in 1559, and it featured prominently in his Acts and Monuments when it was first printed in 1563.[107]"", 'When Elizabeth I came to power in 1558 she restored the Church of England\'s independence from Rome under the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. The church that she re-established represented, in effect, a snapshot of the Edwardine Church from September 1552. Thus the Elizabethan prayer book was basically Cranmer\'s 1552 edition but without the ""Black Rubric"". In the Convocation of 1563 the Forty-two Articles which were never adopted by the Church were altered in the area of eucharistic doctrine to form the Thirty-Nine Articles. Most of the exiles returned to England and resumed their careers in the Church. To some like Edmund Grindal, an Archbishop of Canterbury during Elizabeth\'s reign, Cranmer provided a shining example whose work should be upheld and extended.[109]', 'The Anglican Communion commemorates Thomas Cranmer as a Reformation Martyr on 21 March, the anniversary of his death, and he is remembered in the calendar of saints of the Church of England with a lesser festival.[115][116]', 'The U.S. Episcopal Church liturgical calendar honours him (together with Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley) with a ""day of optional observance"" on 16 October.[117]']"

At twenty-one, he was younger than most of his personnel.[15] Drawing on his technical experience at Westinghouse, he encouraged his pilots to respect their aircraft and the ground crews that maintained them.[16] Initially responsible for the air defence of Perth, No.\xa077 Squadron transferred to Batchelor Airfield near Darwin in August, becoming the first RAAF fighter unit to be stationed in the North-Western Area.[17][18] It moved to another of Darwin\'s satellite airfields, Livingstone, in September.[18][19] Cresswell led the squadron in the defence of Darwin against Japanese raiders and claimed its first aerial victory just after 5\xa0a.m. on 23\xa0November 1942, when he destroyed a Mitsubishi ""Betty"" bomber.[17][20] It was the first ""kill"" for an Australian squadron over the mainland, and the first night victory over Australia.

This course was administered at Williamtown by No.\xa02 OTU's successor formation, No.\xa02 Operational Conversion Unit until 2017, when responsibility for conducting it was transferred to the Tactics and Training Directorate.[114][115][116]"", 'After a series of minor heart attacks and two bypass operations, Cresswell resigned from de\xa0Havilland late in 1974 to live in South-East Queensland; his family elected to remain in Canberra.[126] Cresswell continued his interest in military aviation, maintaining his RAAF connections, and patronising the Australian War Memorial (AWM) and the No.\xa077 Squadron Association.[127] In April 1975 he presented the AWM with the radio operator\'s seat from the ""Betty"" he shot down in November 1942.[21] After divorcing Margaret, he married a third time in 1979 but his new wife died two years later, and he returned to Canberra in the mid-1980s at the urging of his daughters.[128] In 1992 he led members of No.\xa077 Squadron in a march through the streets of Perth, which had granted the unit freedom of entry in recognition of its role in the city\'s defence fifty years earlier.[129] Cresswell also undertook speaking engagements, including the annual veterans\' symposium at the Australian Command and Staff College (ACSC).[130][131] On 23\xa0July 1998, he was at Williamtown for the formal presentation of the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation that had been awarded to No.\xa077 Squadron on 1\xa0November 1951 for its performance in the Korean War.[132] He visited the newly completed Bradbury Aircraft Hall at the AWM in August 2000, commenting, ""The past has a very strong will to live.""[133] The following April, he was among thirty-two Korean War veterans selected to represent Australia at fiftieth anniversary commemorations of the conflict being held in South Korea.[134]']"

Lee at her home in Versailles.[9] Lee was a cousin of future U.S. President Zachary Taylor and aunt of U.S. Senator Wilkinson Call.[10] They had seven children before Sarah died in mid-September 1824.[11] Among their children were Confederate major general George Crittenden and Union general Thomas Leonidas Crittenden. Their daughter Sallie Lee ""Maria"" Crittenden was the mother of John C. Watson, a Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy during the late 19th century.[12] Their daughter Ann Mary Butler Crittenden Coleman published in 1864, Life and Letters of John J. Crittenden, a biography of her father\'s life.[13]', 'Completing his studies in 1806, Crittenden was admitted to the bar the following year.[7][14] He began his practice in Woodford County, but found central Kentucky already well supplied with able lawyers. Crittenden then moved to Logan County, Kentucky, on the then western frontier and opened his practice in Russellville.[5] At age twenty-two, he moved across the Ohio River to Illinois Territory, and Governor Ninian Edwards appointed him its attorney general.[1] The following year, Edwards also made Crittenden his aide-de-camp.[15][a]', ""Crittenden's career as an elected official began in the Kentucky House of Representatives, where he represented Logan County from 1811 to 1817.[14] After the 1811 legislative session, he volunteered as an aide to General Samuel Hopkins in an expedition against the Indians.[19] On the outbreak of the War of 1812, Kentucky governor Charles Scott appointed him as an aide-de-camp for the First Kentucky Militia.[1] In 1813, he became an aide-de-camp to Governor Isaac Shelby, serving at the Battle of the Thames in Canada.[20][21] Following the war, the governor issued him a special commendation for faithfulness in carrying out his orders.[1] He then resumed his law practice in Russellville.[14]"", 'In 1814, Governor Shelby appointed Crittenden to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by his former teacher, George M. Bibb; later, however, Shelby learned that Crittenden was only twenty-seven years old, three years shy of the constitutional age requirement for senators.[22] Hence he returned to his seat in the Kentucky House, where he was elected speaker over John Rowan.[23] He would retain the position from 1815 to 1817.[24]', 'As speaker, Crittenden presided over a particularly tumultuous time in the legislature. In October 1816, recently elected governor George Madison died. He was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Gabriel Slaughter. Slaughter immediately made two extremely unpopular appointments, and quickly fell out of favor with many Kentuckians. A group of legislators, led by John C. Breckinridge, pointed out that the Kentucky Constitution provided only that the lieutenant governor would serve as governor until a new gubernatorial election was held and a qualified successor was chosen. Slaughter, they claimed, was only the ""acting governor"". The group presented a bill to the House that called for new elections. The bill was defeated, but Crittenden supported it.[25]', 'As speaker, Crittenden presided over a particularly tumultuous time in the legislature.

Crittenden joined the Old Court majority in the House in passing a measure to abolish the New Court. The bill was killed in the Senate, however, by the tie-breaking vote of Lieutenant Governor Robert B. McAfee. Crittenden later served on a committee of six to resolve the conflict, but to no avail. He was unwilling to accept a solution whereby all the justices resigned from both courts, and the governor would appoint a reorganized court made up equally of Old Court and New Court supporters. This position cost him the support of some New Court partisans that had voted for him in the previous election, and he was not returned to the House in 1826. Ultimately, Old Court partisans gained control of both houses of the legislature, and the New Court was abolished permanently in December 1826.[37]', 'The court controversy dominated the legislative session.

Morehead appointed Crittenden Secretary of State.[27] In the August elections, Whigs won a majority in both houses of the General Assembly.[52] When the Assembly convened, they elected Crittenden to the U.S. Senate over Democrat James Guthrie by a vote of 94–40.[53]"", ""Immediately upon taking his seat in the Senate, Crittenden was named to the Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on the Judiciary, probably due to Clay's influence.[54] Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton's proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard.[55] He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver.[56] He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution on the Senate floor, but had been tabled by a large majority.[57] Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch's authority.[58] Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.[59]"", ""Shortly after the Caroline affair, President Harrison died and Vice-president John Tyler ascended to the presidency.[29] Tyler resisted Clay's attempts to set the Whig agenda, and vetoed two bank bills against Crittenden's advice.[64] Crittenden and the other Whigs in Tyler's cabinet—excepting Daniel Webster—resigned in protest of Tyler's deviation from the traditional Whig agenda.[29] Crittenden's resignation was effective September 11, 1841.[3] He returned to Kentucky with no political office and very little money.[3] A group of his friends in Woodford County purchased his boyhood home and presented it to him as a gift on his return to Kentucky.[3]"", ""Crittenden was appointed to the United States Senate in 1842, filling the vacancy caused by Clay's resignation.[64] In January 1843, he was elected to a full term over Richard Mentor Johnson.[68] The Whigs' feud with President Tyler continued unabated, and some even talked of impeaching him, but Crittenden condemned that course of action.[68] During the 27th and 28th Congresses, he served on the Committee on Military Affairs.[14] He was an advocate of moderate protective tariffs and federal internal improvements.[68] He opposed giving states the option to forgo apportionment, which would have allowed them to elect their congressmen at-large.[69]"", 'In 1846, the United States entered the Mexican–American War in an attempt to gain control of Texas.[68] Crittenden did not support the war, and after war was declared, he insisted that commissioners accompany the U.S. armies and attempt to broker peace at every opportunity.[3] Throughout the war, he corresponded regularly with Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott.[3] Crittenden\'s sons, George and Thomas, both served in the war; Thomas Crittenden served on Scott\'s staff.[78] President Polk consulted Crittenden regarding the terms of peace that should be accepted to end the war.[78] Crittenden insisted that the terms of peace should not include the acquisition of territory to which the United States did not have a ""just claim"", but the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo submitted to Congress in 1848 called for Mexico to give up its claims not only to Texas, but also to New Mexico, California, and all the territory in between.[79] A few Whigs joined the Democratic majority in Congress to ratify the treaty and defeat the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in the newly acquired territory.[80]', ""Vice President Millard Fillmore ascended to the presidency upon Taylor's death and offered Crittenden the post of Attorney General.[29] Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now much improved, he accepted the offer and resigned the governorship in 1850.[102] Fillmore, an opponent of slavery, requested an opinion from Crittenden on the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law, one of the bills involved in the Compromise of 1850.[103] Specifically, he asked if the law suspended the writ of habeas corpus.[103] Crittenden said that it did not, opining that it discharged a duty placed on Congress by the Constitution to return runaway slaves.[103] Crittenden's opinion was probably motivated by a desire to see the Compromise pass and avert further sectional tension.[104] Fillmore, his misgivings assuaged, signed the bill, keeping the Compromise intact.[103]"", ""In November 1851, the General Assembly convened to elect a successor to Senator Joseph R. Underwood. Underwood, whose term would expire in 1853, desired re-election, and Whigs Charles S. Morehead and George Robertson had also announced their respective candidacies. Crittenden, whose term as attorney general also expired in 1853, had publicly announced that he wished to return to the Senate after his service in President Fillmore's cabinet, and upon learning this, Underwood and Morehead both withdrew from the race. Robertson was not expected to seriously challenge Crittenden, but following the withdrawals of the other candidates, Archibald Dixon entered the race.

Though it was believed that Republicans in general, including their representatives on the committee, were disposed to accept Crittenden's compromise or one substantially similar to it, President-elect Lincoln had already instructed his trusted allies in the legislature to resist any plan to extend slavery into the territories. Consequently, when the committee held its first meeting, the Republican members blocked Crittenden's plan and six others from coming to the floor for a vote. Despite their opposition, however, the Republicans presented no alternative plan. After the rejection of Crittenden's plan in committee, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia followed South Carolina's lead and passed ordinances of secession.[128]"", ""Crittenden remained in Washington for a few weeks after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabamian serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in light of his state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, and by the time he definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.[130]"", 'Having failed to secure compromise at the federal level, Crittenden returned to Kentucky in early 1861, attempting to persuade his home state to reject the overtures of fellow southern states and remain in the Union.[131] On May 10, 1861, a conference was held to decide Kentucky\'s course in the war.[3] Crittenden joined Archibald Dixon and S. S. Nicholas as Unionist representatives at the conference; the Southern Rights position was represented by John C. Breckinridge, Governor Beriah Magoffin, and Richard Hawes.[132] The conference failed to produce a united course of action, but adopted the policy of armed neutrality.[3][131] Unionists in the legislature, however, feared that the state militia and its commander Simon Bolivar Buckner, had Confederate sympathies.[133] To counter any threat that the militia would seize control of the state for the South, the General Assembly organized the Home Guard, a separate militia controlled by a five-man, pro-Union commission.[133] Crittenden enlisted in the Home Guard as a private and was part of a group styled the ""Union Defense Committee"" that secured weapons for the Home Guard from the federal government.[134]', ""President Lincoln called a special session of Congress to convene July 4, 1861, and Kentucky held special elections in June to select congressmen for the special session. Crittenden had expressed his desire to retire from public service and initially refused pleas to become a candidate, but he finally consented to run in late May. He was elected over secessionist candidate William E. Simms; in all, nine of Kentucky's ten congressional districts selected Unionist candidates in the special election. Upon taking his seat, he was assigned to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. On July 10, 1861, he accompanied Simon B. Buckner on a visit to President Lincoln to secure a renewed commitment from Lincoln to respect Kentucky's neutrality; Lincoln agreed only to issue a declaration that he had no present designs on Kentucky but would not commit to restrict his future actions. In order to calm the fears of border state citizens concerned about the Union's objectives in the war, he introduced the Crittenden–Johnson Resolution, which blamed the secessionist states for the war and stated that the object of the war was not the subjugation of those states, but the defense of the Constitution and the preservation of the Union. When those ends were achieved, the resolution stated, the war should cease. Kentucky Representative Henry C. Burnett asked that the question be divided. Burnett was one of only two votes against the portion of the resolution blaming the Southern states for the war; the only dissent on the remaining portion came from Wisconsin's John F. Potter and Ohio's Albert G. Riddle. In the Senate, the resolution passed 30–5, with Kentucky senators Breckinridge and Powell voting in the minority.[137] In December 1861 the House refused, by a vote of 76–65, to reaffirm the resolution.[138]""]"

Williams, as coach for the Army team. Navy had first extended the offer to Camp, who suggested Crosby would fulfil the role more effectively. Crosby accepted the invitation,[10] and became the second head coach in Navy history and the first who was independent of the program.[11] The previous coach, Vaulx Carter, attended the academy, and had revived the program.[12] Crosby's strategy for practices was one of the most intensive used at the academy during its early years; after classes every day, the team played two 45 minute games against a team of 22 backup players, followed immediately by a long swimming session in a cold pool.[11][13] Shortly before the season began, Crosby hired former St. John's College, Johns Hopkins, and Lehigh player Paul Dashiell to serve as his assistant coach.[13]"", ""The 1892 season commenced on October 12 with a 16–0 shutout loss against the Penn Quakers in Annapolis. The Quakers finished the season with a 15–1 record, losing only to national champion Yale. Crosby's team played their next game three days later, against the Princeton Tigers. Navy lost the game in another shutout, by the score of 28–0. These losses continued a losing streak dating back to November 21 of the previous year.[14][15] The following week, on October 22, Crosby achieved his first coaching win when Navy defeated the Lafayette Leopards 22–4. This was followed by a victory the next week over the small Franklin & Marshall College; Navy won in a 24–0 shutout, their largest such win since the 1890 Army–Navy Game. They continued their winning streak into November with a 48–12 victory against Rutgers, the largest win for Navy since the beginning of the 1890 season. After a week's break, Crosby received his fourth win, a forty-point shutout of nearby Georgetown.[14][16]"", 'The final game of the season was the annual Army–Navy Game against Navy\'s biggest rivals, the unbeaten Army Cadets. Navy had unexpectedly lost to the Cadets in the previous year\'s game, and came into the 1892 game as an underdog.[17] Despite this, Crosby expected a victory, even telling reporters he was ""of the opinion that they [Navy] will certainly win"".[18] Crosby also caught the attention of the press with his scheduling of more frequent practices leading up to the game, including night practices on a lighted field. He closed all press and fan access to the practices, an unusual action at the time, because Navy officials claimed that Army had learned their plays the prior year by observing the practices.[19][20] Crosby\'s actions proved effective as, on November 26 at West Point, Navy led Army for the entire game and won easily, 12–4.[14][17] About a month after the game, in appreciation for his coaching Navy to the win, the team presented Crosby an eight-inch high sterling silver loving cup, produced by the Gorham Manufacturing Company, which was inscribed with the simple message: ""Benjamin L.

He spent 1994 commanding the brigade and overseeing training and, in 1995, was posted to Bosnia along with his headquarters staff, leaving the rest of the brigade in Germany and taking command of separate units already deployed in Bosnia.[29] He commanded UNPROFOR's Sector South West, composed of troops from multiple nations, while also serving as Commander of British Forces (COMBRITFOR), responsible for overseeing operations of all British troops in Bosnia.[30] After the signing of the Dayton Agreement in November 1995, UNPROFOR became the NATO-led Implementation Force and Dannatt's brigade was incorporated into a multi-national division commanded by Mike Jackson.[31] Dannatt was later appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his service in the Balkans.[32]"", ""Returning to the 3rd Division, Dannatt planned two exercises at the British Army Training Unit Suffield in Canada. The first was, at the time, the largest exercise the army had run since the end of the Cold War; the second only took place after Dannatt's tenure as commander had expired.[38] Dannatt gave evidence as an expert witness in the trial of Radislav Krstić in relation to the Srebrenica massacre, shortly after which he was posted to Bosnia, where he served as deputy commander of NATO's Stabilisation Force in 2000.[39] His tour, originally scheduled to last a full year was cut short when Sir Michael Willcocks took early retirement from the army in order to become Black Rod. The resulting personnel changes to fill the vacancy meant that Dannatt was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff (ACGS) in April 2001.[40][41] In September 2001, he was on a visit to British troops in Cyprus and watched the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks on television.[42] As ACGS, he was peripherally involved in planning for the army's subsequent involvement in Afghanistan and later Iraq, as well as standing in for the Chief of the General Staff (then Michael Walker) when Walker was unavailable.

He also repeated his previous assertions that the army had been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests.

Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the Blackpool seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.', 'In 1901, when Annie Horniman\'s travelling theatrical company visited Oxford, Davidson fell in love with one of the company\'s leading actresses, Moyra (""Molly"") Cassandra Saurin, an attractive blonde and blue-eyed woman from County Meath in Ireland. The couple were quickly engaged, but the relationship was stormy and was several times broken off.[11] There was no question of marriage until Davidson was fully established in his new profession. His first church appointment was a curacy at Holy Trinity Church, Windsor, Berkshire,[10] with an additional role as assistant chaplain to the Household Cavalry at Combermere Barracks.[13] In 1905 he was transferred to London as curate at St Martin-in-the-Fields, where his enthusiasm and industry drew approving comments.[14]', ""On 9 October 1906, now settled into a prosperous living, Davidson married Molly Saurin. The Stiffkey rectory became a family home, as children were born at regular intervals.[23][n 4] Notwithstanding his parochial and domestic responsibilities, Davidson quickly adopted the habit of spending much of the week in London, engaged in various kinds of social work. Through his friendship with Reginald Kennedy-Cox, whom he had met at Oxford, Davidson became involved with the Malvern Mission, forerunner of the Dockland Settlements, of which he later became a trustee.[24][n 5] He also became chaplain to the Actors' Church Union, based at St Paul's, Covent Garden, and was frequently to be found backstage in London's theatres, ministering to the needs of showgirls—sometimes with an unwelcomed degree of persistence.[24][25] Between 1910 and 1913 he expanded this work to Paris, to which he made regular visits, sometimes acting as a chaperone for dancers recruited by the Folies Bergère.[24][26] Many out-of-work and would-be actresses were invited to stay at the Stiffkey rectory, sometimes as many as 20 at a time, to the consternation of Molly Davidson and of some of the local establishment who feared for the morals of local farmhands. Among those most disapproving of Davidson's conduct was Major Philip Hamond, a churchwarden at Morston, who later became Davidson's principal adversary.[27]"", 'Although many of Davidson\'s parishioners accepted that his London rescue mission was entirely honourable, some, including Major Hamond, were less convinced. Hamond was suspicious of the stream of visitors that Davidson brought to the Stiffkey rectory and thought he was neglecting his parochial duties.[45] In 1927 relations between the two men worsened when Davidson, in a letter which Tucker describes as ""breathless in its rudeness and insensitivity"", upbraided the major for clearing the ground in the Morston churchyard alongside his recently deceased wife\'s grave: ""Morston Churchyard is the private freehold property of the Rector of Morston\xa0... you have no possible right to interfere with it in any way without my permission any more than I have the right to come and annex a part of your garden.""[46] On one occasion, Davidson arrived late at Morston to officiate at a communion service, having forgotten the bread and wine; enraged, Hamond ordered him back to the rectory to collect it.[45] An even greater lapse, in Hamond\'s eyes, was Davidson\'s failure to return to Stiffkey in time to officiate at the 1930 Armistice Day ceremony at the local war memorial.[47]', 'A consistory court was convened for 29 March 1932, under the presidency of the Norwich diocesan chancellor, F. Keppel North.[54] Davidson was accused of associating with ""women of loose character"", and ""accosting, molesting, and importuning young females for immoral purposes"". The prosecution\'s case was in the hands of a high-profile legal team, headed by Roland Oliver KC and including the future cabinet minister Walter Monckton.[56] Davidson, meanwhile, engaged experienced lawyers to defend him, funding this partly through the sale of newspaper stories.[57] Because of the level of press interest, and the number of London-based witnesses involved, the court sat in Church House, Westminster, rather than in Norwich.[54]', 'Molly Davidson had managed to acquire a small house in South Harrow, where Davidson spent his winters.[89] Off-season he worked sporadically, at one time as a door-to-door book salesman and on other as a porter at St Pancras railway station.[90] He could not avoid press attention; in November 1936 he was arrested and fined for pestering two 16-year-old girls at Victoria station—he had approached them offering auditions for a leading role in a West End show.[91] That same month he interrupted a Church Assembly at Central Hall, Westminster, at which the Archbishop of Canterbury was present. Davidson was prevented from addressing the meeting, at which he dropped numerous copies of a mimeographed pamphlet titled ""I Accuse"", in which he listed his grievances and castigated the Church\'s hierarchy.[92]', 'From the Church Times, 15 July 1932, quoted in Tucker, p. 115.[102]', 'The question of Davidson\'s treatment by the consistory court was first raised by the Church Times immediately after the trial. A leading article argued that, although Davidson\'s conduct had been ""foolish and eccentric"", his intentions at least at the start of his ministry had been guided by idealism. Chancellor North was criticised both for lacking compassion and for the general conduct of the proceedings: ""No experienced criminal solicitor could conceivably have blundered so badly and consistently.""[102] In 2006 Davidson\'s granddaughter, Karylin Collier, privately published a brief biography, The Rector of Stiffkey: His Life and Trial, in which she maintains the innocence of all the charges against him.[110] Tucker argues that ""Harold Davidson probably deserved to be quietly defrocked for his shortcomings as a priest"", but nevertheless believes that he was not an immoral man. He also highlights the incompetent presentation of Davidson\'s case by his legal team, particularly their failure to question the provenance of the Barbara Harris letter. Tucker concludes that since the proceedings were flawed and the evidence of immorality flimsy, the Church of England owes it to the Davidson family to re-examine the original findings.[55]']"

I have no recollection of receiving any teaching upon Churchmanship, either Episcopal or Presbyterian, the religion taught us being wholly of the personal sort but beautiful in its simplicity.""[3] Davidson\'s biographer George Bell writes that the Davidsons were deeply religious without being solemn, and that it was a happy household.[4] Davidson was educated by his mother and a succession of governesses and private tutors, before being sent, aged 12, to a small private school at Worksop in the English Midlands. The teaching there was inadequate; in particular, Davidson regretted all his life his lack of grounding in Latin and Greek.[5]', 'Late in 1876 Craufurd Tait, who was working as his father\'s resident chaplain and private secretary, wished to move on and the Archbishop chose Davidson to succeed him.[21] In May 1877 Davidson began work at Lambeth Palace, the Archbishop\'s home and headquarters, beginning what Bell describes as ""an association with the central life of the Church of England which lasted more than fifty years"".[25] Craufurd Tait died after a brief illness in May 1878;[26] his mother never recovered from this blow and died within the year.[27][28] Despite the Archbishop\'s offers of several attractive parishes over the following years, Davidson felt his place was at the side of the bereaved Tait, who came more and more to rely on him, and called him a ""true son"".[29] Bell sees this as altruism on Davidson\'s part; later biographers have suggested that there may also have been an element of personal ambition in his decision to remain at the centre of church affairs.[2][30][n 3]', 'Within his diocese Davidson was drawn into controversy over a high-church breach of canon law by Robert Dolling, a fervent Anglo-Catholic priest, who liked to be called ""Father Dolling"". Davidson discovered that Dolling had installed a third altar at his newly built church, to be reserved for masses for the dead. The Church of England disowned the Roman Catholic belief in Purgatory and the efficacy of praying for souls in it.[n 11] Davidson saw Dolling and tried to reach a compromise that would bring the latter\'s practices within Anglican rules. Dolling refused to compromise and resigned, leaving the diocese.[57] His supporters were critical of Davidson; Mews cites a high-church journalist who concluded that the episode left its mark on Davidson ""in forming his determination not to be the archbishop who drove the high-church party out of the Church of England"".[2] Though traditionally Protestant in his rejection of some aspects of Roman Catholic doctrine such as Benediction, he thought his evangelical colleagues were too easily upset by ""incense, copes and other adornments"", which had no doctrinal significance.[58]', 'Davidson\'s constant concern was for what he called ""the great central party in the English Church"".[67] He was a prime mover in efforts to update the Book of Common Prayer to make it comprehensible to 20th century congregations, and he aimed to accommodate all the clergy of the Church of England within Anglican doctrine, bringing the few high-church extremists back into obedience to church rules.[6] With his cautious support, Balfour set up a Royal Commission to enquire into and propose remedies for the prevalent disorders in the church. It concluded that the church needed more control over its own affairs, but that the laws governing its practices must be enforced.[6][68] Davidson was neither a diehard conservative nor an adventurous reformer, but steered a middle course. On the government\'s wish to reform the marriage laws to allow a widower to marry his late wife\'s sister he opposed reform (unsuccessfully);[n 12] on the interpretation of the Athanasian Creed he took a liberal line.[n 13]', ""In August 1904 Davidson, accompanied by his wife, sailed to the United States to attend the triennial convention of the American Episcopal Church; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to visit the US.[6] He met many church leaders in the US and Canada, and established closer links between the Anglican churches of England and North America.[71] This accomplishment abroad was followed by a setback at home: Davidson's unsuccessful attempt to bring political leaders to agree about national education policy. The Liberals had opposed the passage of the 1902 Education Act, and once in office in 1906 they reopened the issue. Their attempts at further reform were opposed by the Conservatives, and from 1906 to 1908 Davidson strove to bring the two sides to compromise. His failure to secure agreement and achieve a cohesive primary education system was one of the major regrets of his life.[72] In 1907 Davidson disappointed some Liberals by not explicitly backing state old-age pensions, but he declined to do so merely in the abstract, insisting on detailed proposals before expressing support.[73] He was much more forthcoming on atrocities by the Belgians in the Congo and the Bulgarians in Macedonia, which he condemned vehemently.[74]"", 'In July and August 1908 Davidson presided over the fifth Lambeth Conference of bishops from the world-wide Anglican communion;[75] 241 bishops were present.[76] The chief subjects of discussion were: the relations of faith and modern thought; the supply and training of the clergy; education; foreign missions; revision and ""enrichment"" of the Prayer-book; the relation of the church to ""ministries of healing"" such as Christian Science; the questions of marriage and divorce; organisation of the Anglican Church; and reunion with other churches.[76] Public interest focused on the bishops\' desire for Christian unity. The resolutions showed a will for reunion, but a caution in taking any step towards the nonconformists that might destroy the possibility of ultimate reunion with the Roman Catholic or Orthodox churches.[6]', 'Skirmishing between Anglican factions continued with the Kikuyu controversy in 1913–14.[87] William George Peel, who was the Bishop of Mombasa and John Jamieson Willis, the Bishop of Uganda, attended an interdenominational missionary conference at the Church of Scotland\'s parish in Kikuyu, British East Africa, during which they took part in an ecumenical communion service together with their nonconformist colleagues.[88] For this, and their agreement to cooperate with other churches in their missionary work, they were denounced by Frank Weston, the Bishop of Zanzibar. Weston, described by Mews as a ""champion of Anglo-Catholic hardliners"", sought their trial for heresy. He was backed by the Bishop of Oxford, Charles Gore, the most vociferous of the Anglo-Catholic bishops.[n 19]  Davidson\'s private view was that the attending bishops had been ""rash"" but the denunciations by Weston and Gore ""preposterous"" and ""absurdly vituperative"".[90] The issue was debated in the press for several weeks but Davidson\'s inclusive and pragmatic views prevailed, and the controversy dwindled away.[2][35]', 'Up to this point the Church of England had little power to make its own rules. As the established church it was subject to parliamentary control, and had no independent authority to initiate legislation.[105] The Enabling Act, strongly backed by Davidson, gave the church the right to submit primary legislation for passage by Parliament.[106] The historian Jeremy Morris calls it ""probably the most significant single piece of legislation passed by Parliament for the Church of England in the twentieth century"",[107] and summarises its effects:', ""It led to the full integration of lay representatives with the two houses of clergy and bishops into a new Church Assembly. It provided some legislative autonomy for the Church, thus drawing the sting of anti-establishmentarian criticism, and instituted at local level the Parochial Church Councils which constitute the bedrock of the Church of England's representative system today.[107]"", 'The historian Matthew Grimley describes the prayer-book controversy of 1927–28 as ""the last great parliamentary battle over Church and state"".[117] Davidson\xa0– like his Tudor predecessor Thomas Cranmer, according to The Times\xa0– had ""immense and perhaps excessive faith in a new Prayer-book as a means of composing differences and restoring discipline within the Church"".[6] He also considered that a modern Prayer-book would enrich Anglican services and make them relevant to 20th-century needs unforeseen when Cranmer and his colleagues wrote the original version in the 16th century.[6][n 23] Work had been going on under his supervision since 1906, and in 1927 a version was finally ready. The Church Assembly approved it, and it was put to Parliament for authorisation. The House of Lords agreed it by an unexpectedly large majority of 241 votes. The measure then went before the House of Commons, where it was introduced by William Bridgeman, who made a listless speech that did not impress MPs.[119] Opposing, William Joynson-Hicks spoke vehemently, maintaining that the new Prayer-book opened the door to Romish practices.[120][121] Davidson privately wrote of Bridgeman\'s speech, ""He absolutely muffed it. It was a poor speech with no knowledge and no fire"";[122] Bell calls Joynson-Hicks\'s speech ""flashy"" but ""abundantly successful"".[119] The Commons rejected the bill by 238 votes to 205.[123] The MP Austen Chamberlain described Davidson as ""a tragically pathetic figure as he left\xa0... after the result"".[124] The Times said:', 'A second attempt the following year was voted down in the Commons on 14 June 1928. After that defeat Davidson told the Church Assembly:', 'It is a fundamental principle that the Church\xa0– that is, the Bishops together with the Clergy and the Laity\xa0– must in the last resort, when its mind has been fully ascertained, retain its inalienable right, in loyalty to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to formulate its Faith in Him and to arrange the expression of that Holy Faith in its forms of worship.[125]', 'Davidson commented to a friend in 1928, ""If I was describing myself I should say I was a funny old fellow of quite mediocre, second-rate gifts and a certain amount of common sense – but that I had tried to do my best; I have tried\xa0– and I have tried to stick to my duty; but that is really all there is about it.""[142] Historians have rated him more highly, although in a 2017 study, Michael Hughes comments that Davidson has ""largely slipped from public memory, and perhaps even from that of the Church"",[143] his reputation eclipsed by successors such as William Temple or Michael Ramsey whose public profiles were considerably higher.[144] Hastings calls him ""perhaps the most influential of churchmen"", because he was ""a man of remarkable balance of judgment, intellectual humility, sense of responsibility and capacity for work\xa0... His great sense of public moral responsibility gave him an influence and a position which were remarkable"".[145] The historian Keith Robbins observes that Davidson ""did not attempt to resolve differences of outlook and doctrine at an intellectual level. The Church of England had always contained many mansions and it was his task to prevent the sinking of this particular bark of Christ by one faction or another. He was, on the whole, remarkably successful in a sober, uninspiring way"".[146] In a 1966 study of the Church of England, Roger Lloyd writes:', 'Bell\'s conclusion is that Davidson ""immensely increased the influence of the Anglican communion in Christendom, and he saw the Church of England taking far more of a world view than it had taken previously"".

After graduating from Oxford University, he joined the BBC's children's department, CBBC, in 1985 on a part-time basis and held various positions, which included creating two series, Dark Season and Century Falls. He eventually left the BBC for Granada Television, and in 1994 began writing adult television drama. His early scripts generally explored concepts of religion and sexuality among various backdrops: Revelations was a soap opera about organised religion and featured a lesbian vicar; Springhill was a soap drama about a Catholic family in contemporary Liverpool; The Grand explored society's opinion of subjects such as prostitution, abortion and homosexuality during the interwar period; and Queer as Folk recreated his experiences in the Manchester gay scene. His work in the 2000s included Bob & Rose, which portrayed a gay man who fell in love with a woman; The Second Coming, which focused on the second coming and deicide of Jesus Christ from a mostly non-religious point of view; Mine All Mine, a comedy about a family who discover they own the entire city of Swansea; and Casanova, an adaptation of the complete memoirs of Venetian adventurer Giacomo Casanova.""]"

During his final combat mission in northwestern Korea, Davis surprised and attacked twelve Chinese MiG-15 fighter jets, downing two of the MiG-15s before he was shot down and killed. Davis was the only flying ace of the United States to be killed in action in Korea. Controversies remain surrounding the circumstances of his death."", 'On March 21, 1942, Davis enlisted in the United States Army in Lubbock, Texas, just after the US entry into World War II.[4] On June 3, he was appointed an aviation cadet in the Army Air Corps. He was moved to Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas, for pre-flight training, which he completed in August. He was then moved to Jones Field in Bonham, Texas, for primary flight training. During this training, he got his first 60 hours of flight time aboard a Fairchild PT-19 trainer aircraft. Then he flew for another 74 hours during Basic Flight Training in Waco, Texas, and underwent a final stint of training aboard the T-6 Texan at Aloe Field in Victoria, Texas. On February 16, 1943, Davis completed his training, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Army Reserve, and was immediately ordered into active duty with the Army Air Forces.[5] By this time he had accrued 314 hours of flight time.[8]', 'Davis was flown to Port Moresby, New Guinea, where he was quickly reassigned to the 342nd Fighter Squadron, 348th Fighter Group of the Fifth United States Air Force.[7] The group flew the P-47 Thunderbolt fighter plane.[5] By December, his unit moved to Finschhafen, where it was able to operate over the Solomon Sea against the air forces of the Empire of Japan, and he quickly earned the ironic nickname ""Curly"" because of his straight black hair.[1][5] Davis was known among the pilots to be particularly confident.[9] Davis served under the command of Colonel Neel E. Kearby, who himself would later receive the Medal of Honor. Many of the other pilots in the unit would quickly become aces as they participated in the conflict.[8]', ""After the war's end, Davis served in several administrative positions in the United States. On August 10, 1945, he was assigned to the 556th Air Base Unit at Long Beach, California. On August 24, 1946, he was offered a commission as a first lieutenant in the active duty Army Air Corps, demoting him from his temporary rank but effectively allowing him to stay in the military despite the demobilization and downsizing of the US military. Several weeks later, on September 7, Davis was ordered to the 554th Air Base Unit in Memphis, Tennessee, where he served on one of the Army Air Corps aerobatic demonstration teams, the predecessors to the United States Air Force Thunderbirds.[7][14]"", 'Davis returned to front-line units on January 6, 1947, when he was moved to the 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 1st Fighter Group. He remained with this formation for most of the year. On September 18, 1947, the United States Air Force was created as a separate branch of the US Military. Davis was commissioned as a captain in the new branch. During his time with the 71st Squadron, Davis attended Air Tactical School and Tyndall Air Force Base. He was also a flight commander and air inspector while with the unit.[15]', ""In late January 1951, the Air Force told Davis it wanted to rotate him back to the United States. By this point, Davis held every record for a jet pilot, including most victories in all types of aircraft, most MiGs destroyed and most victories over propeller-driven aircraft. However, the Air Force determined it had no capable replacement who could command Davis's squadron,[1][8] and other pilots indicated they wanted him to stay, considering him to be an able and effective leader."", ""The MiGs were 8,000 feet (2,400\xa0m) below Davis and Littlefield and had not noticed them.[21] Without hesitating, Davis immediately flew behind the MiG-15 formation and attacked them from the rear. His surprise attack destroyed one of the MiG-15s, and he quickly turned to the next closest MiG and destroyed it before it could outmaneuver him.[6] By this time, Davis and Littlefield had overtaken many of the MiGs, and some that were behind them began firing.[1] Davis then moved to target a third MiG at the front of the formation, but as he was lining up his shot a MiG scored a direct hit on Davis's fuselage, causing his aircraft to spin out of control.[6][22] Littlefield said later that he had spotted Davis's landing gear open, indicating hydraulic failure, and that he had attempted to defend Davis's aircraft as it lost altitude until Davis crashed and died.[23] Littlefield reported that he had not seen Davis bail out of his aircraft. Davis was declared missing in action and presumed killed.[21] Intense aerial searches of the area later revealed no evidence that Davis had survived the crash.[1] Indeed, a week after the incident, the Chinese military searched the region and recovered Davis's body, which was found in the crashed aircraft.[24] The Chinese never returned Davis's body to the United States.[25]"", ""Davis's wife, Doris Davis, expressed anger toward the Air Force after his death, claiming that he had wanted to return to the United States after he became an ace, but had not been allowed to. She also claimed that he had been forced against his will into combat duty in Korea. Her complaints caused media attention to become focused on the Far East Air Force and its policies regarding the rotation of troops and pilots into and out of duty in Korea. Davis's wife had been a vocal opponent of the war since its beginning;[22] she publicly denounced it after Davis's death, which  widows of American soldiers rarely did during the war.[21]"", 'Throughout his career, Davis was credited with 21 confirmed victories, one probable victory and two aircraft damaged. This made him one of only 30 US pilots to gain more than 20 confirmed victories over their careers.[15] He had been known to be an extremely talented pilot and was especially accurate at deflection shooting, even from long distances against moving targets.[7] Davis was one of 1,297 World War II aces from the United States, with seven confirmed kills during that war. He later became one of 41 Korean War aces from the United States, with 14 confirmed victories during that war. At the time of his death, he was the top-scoring ace from the US, making him the ace of aces. By the end of the war, he was the fourth-highest-scoring ace.[6]', ""The President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to Major George Andrew Davis, Jr. (AFSN: 0-671514/13035A), United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Squadron Commander, 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, FIFTH Air Force, on 27 November 1951, during an engagement with enemy aircraft near Sinanju, Korea. While leading a group formation of thirty-two F-86 aircraft on a counter air mission, Major Davis observed six MIG-15 aircraft headed southward above the group. With exemplary leadership and superior airmanship, he maneuvered his forces into position for attack. Leading with great tactical skill and courage, Major Davis closed to 800 feet on a MIG-15 over Namsi. He fired on the enemy aircraft, which immediately began burning. A few seconds later, the enemy pilot bailed out of his aircraft. Continuing the attack on the enemy forces, Major Davis fired on the wingman of the enemy flight, which resulted in numerous strikes on the wing roots and the fuselage. As Major Davis broke off his relentless attack on this MIG-15, another MIG-15 came down on him. He immediately brought his aircraft into firing position upon the enemy and after a sustained barrage of fire, the enemy pilot bailed out. Although low on fuel, he rejoined his group and reorganized his forces to engage the approximate 80 enemy aircraft making the attack. Against overwhelming odds, Major Davis' group destroyed two other MIG-15 aircraft, probably destroyed one and damaged one other. Major Davis' aggressive leadership, his flying skill and devotion to duty contributed invaluable to the United Nations' cause and reflect great credit on himself, the Far East Air forces and the United States Air Force.[40]""]"

Immediately after the war, Davis was often blamed for the Confederacy's defeat, but after his release from prison, he became a hero of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.

President Polk approved their purchase as a political favor in return for Davis marshalling enough votes to pass the Walker Tariff.[72] Because of its association with the regiment, the weapon became known as the ""Mississippi rifle"",[73] and the regiment became known as the ""Mississippi Rifles"".[74]', 'Davis took his seat in December 1847 and was made a regent of the Smithsonian Institution.[82] The Mississippi legislature confirmed his appointment as senator in January 1848.[83] He quickly established himself as an advocate of expanding slavery into the Western territories. He argued that because the territories were the common property of all the United States and lacked state sovereignty to ban slavery, slave owners had the equal right to settle them as any other citizens.[84]  Davis tried to amend the Oregon Bill to allow settlers to bring their slaves into Oregon Territory.[85] He opposed ratifying the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican–American War, claiming that Nicholas Trist, who negotiated the treaty, had done so as a private citizen and not a government representative.[86] Instead, he advocated negotiating a new treaty ceding additional land to the United States,[87] and opposed the application of the Wilmot Proviso to the treaty,[88] which would have banned slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico.[89]', ""In March 1853, President Franklin Pierce named Davis his Secretary of War.[102] He championed a transcontinental railroad to the Pacific, arguing it was needed for national defense,[103] and was entrusted with overseeing the Pacific Railroad Surveys to determine which of four possible routes was the best.[104] He promoted the Gadsden Purchase of today's southern Arizona from Mexico, partly because he preferred a southern route for the new railroad. The Pierce administration agreed and the land was purchased in December 1853.[105] He presented the surveys' findings in 1855, but they failed to clarify the best route and sectional problems prevented any choice being made.[106] Davis also argued for the acquisition of Cuba from Spain, seeing it as an opportunity to add the island, a strategic military location and potential slave state.[107] He suggested that the size of the regular army was too small and that its salaries were too meagre. Congress agreed and authorized four new regiments and increased its pay scale.[108] He ended the manufacture of smoothbore muskets and shifted production to rifles, working to develop the tactics that accompany them.[109] He oversaw the building of public works in Washington D.C., including the initial construction of the Washington Aqueduct.[110]"", ""Davis assisted in the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 by allowing President Pierce to endorse it before it came up for a vote.[111] This bill, which created Kansas and Nebraska territories, repealed the Missouri Compromise's limits on slavery and left the decision about a territory's slaveholding status to popular sovereignty, which allowed the territory's residents to decide.[112] The passage of this bill led to the demise of the Whig party, which had tried to limit expansion of slavery in the territories. It also contributed to the rise of the Republican Party and the increase of civil violence in Kansas.[113]"", 'The Democratic nomination for the 1856 presidential election went to James Buchanan.[114] Knowing his term was over when the Pierce administration ended in 1857, Davis ran for the Senate once more and re-entered it on March 4, 1857.[115] In the same month, the United States Supreme Court decided the Dred Scott case, which ruled that slavery could not be barred from any territory.[116]', 'Davis\'s participation in the Senate was interrupted in early 1858 by a recurring case of iritis, which threatened the loss of his left eye.[120] It left him bedridden for seven weeks.[121] He spent the summer of 1858 in Portland, Maine recovering, and gave speeches in Maine, Boston, and New York, emphasizing the common heritage of all Americans and the importance of the constitution for defining the nation.[122] His speeches angered some states\' rights supporters in the South, requiring him to clarify his comments when he returned to Mississippi.

Breckinridge was nominated by the South[128]—and the Republican Party nominee Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election.[129] Davis counselled moderation after the election,[130] but South Carolina adopted an ordinance of secession on December 20, 1860.

G. T. Beauregard to command all Confederate troops in the vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina.[147] Davis sent a commission to Washington to negotiate the evacuation of the forts, but President of the United States Lincoln refused to meet with it.[148]', 'As the Southern states seceded, state authorities took over most federal facilities without bloodshed.

Davis saw this as attempt to destroy the South by inciting its enslaved people to revolt,[197] declaring the proclamation ""the most execrable measure recorded in the history of guilty man"".[198] He requested a law that Union officers captured in Confederate states be delivered to state authorities and put on trial for inciting slave rebellion.[199] In response, the Congress passed a law that Union officers of United States Colored Troops could be tried and executed, though none were during the war. The law also stated that captured black soldiers would be turned over to the states they were captured in to be dealt with as the state saw fit.[200]', 'There was no consensus on how to use cotton to gain European support. Davis did not want an embargo on cotton,[262] he wanted to make cotton available to European nations, but require them to acquire it by violating the blockade declared by the Union.  The majority of Congress wanted an embargo to coerce Europe to help the South.[263] Though there was no official policy, cotton was effectively embargoed.[264] By 1862, the price of cotton in Europe had quadrupled and European imports of cotton from the United States were down 96%,[265] but instead of joining with the Confederacy, European cotton manufacturers found new sources, such as India, Egypt and Brazil.[266] By the end of the war, not a single foreign nation had recognized the Confederate States of America.[267]', ""President Andrew Johnson's cabinet was unsure what to do with Davis.

In late summer 1865, Attorney General James Speed determined that it was best to try Davis for treason in a civil criminal trial.[286] In June 1866, the House of Representatives passed a resolution by a vote of 105 to 19 to put Davis on trial for treason.[287] Davis also desired a trial to vindicate his actions.[288] His defense lawyer, Charles O'Conor wanted to argue that Davis did not commit treason because he was no longer a citizen of the United States when Mississippi left the United States.[289] The trial was to be held in Richmond, which might be sympathetic to Davis, and an acquittal could be interpreted as validating the constitutionality of secession.[290]"", ""President Andrew Johnson's cabinet was unsure what to do with Davis.

He declined because Varina also did not want to live in Texas,[313] recommending Thomas S. Gathright instead.[314]  He worked for an English company, the Mississippi Valley Society, to promote trade and European immigration. When he and Varina went to Europe again in 1876, he determined the company was failing. He returned to the United States while Varina stayed in England.[315]', ""In January 1877, the author Sarah Dorsey invited him to live on her estate at Beauvoir, Mississippi, and to begin writing his memoirs. He agreed, but insisted on paying board.[321] At the time, Davis and Varina lived separately. When Varina came back to the United States, she initially refused to come to Beauvoir because she did not like Davis's close relationship with Dorsey, who was serving as his amanuensis. In the summer of 1878, Varina relented, moving to Beauvoir and taking over the role of Davis's assistant.[322] Dorsey died in July 1879, and left Beauvoir to Davis in her will, and he lived there for most of his remaining years.[323]"", ""In 1886, Henry W. Grady, an advocate for the New South, convinced Davis to lay the cornerstone for a monument to the Confederate dead in Montgomery, Alabama, and to attend the unveilings of statues memorializing Davis's friend Benjamin H. Hill in Savannah and the Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene in Atlanta.[331] The tour was a triumph for Davis and got extensive newspaper coverage, which emphasized national unity and the South's role as a permanent part of the United States. At each stop along the way, large crowds came out to cheer Davis, solidifying his image as an icon of the South and the Confederacy.[332] In October 1887, Davis held his last tour, traveling to the Georgia State Fair in Macon, Georgia, for a grand reunion with Confederate veterans.[333]"", ""Although Davis served the United States as a soldier and a war hero, a politician who sat in both houses of Congress, and a cabinet officer,[379] his legacy is mainly defined by his role as president of the Confederacy.[380] After the Civil War, journalist Edward A. Pollard, who first popularized the Lost Cause mythology,[381] placed much of the blame for losing the war on Davis.[382] Into the twentieth century, many biographers and historians have also emphasized Davis's responsibility for the Confederacy's failure to achieve independence.[383] Since the second half of the twentieth century, this assumption has been questioned. Some scholars argued that he was a capable leader, while acknowledging his skills were insufficient to overcome the challenges the Confederacy faced[384] and exploring how his limitations may have contributed to the war's outcome.[385]"", ""Davis's standing among white Southerners was at a low point at the end of the Civil War,[386] but it rebounded after his release from prison.[387] After Reconstruction, he became a venerated figure of the white South,[388] and he was often depicted as a martyr who suffered for his nation.[389] His birthday was made a legal holiday in six Southern states.[390] His popularity among white Southerners remained strong in the early twentieth century. Around 200,000 people attended the unveiling of the Jefferson Davis Memorial at Richmond, Virginia, in 1907.[391] In 1961, a centennial celebration reenacted Davis's inauguration in Montgomery, Alabama, with fireworks and a cast of thousands in period costumes.[392] In the early twenty-first century, there were at least 144 Confederate memorials commemorating him throughout the United States.[393]"", ""On October 17, 1978, Davis's U.S. citizenship was posthumously restored after the Senate passed Joint Resolution 16. President Jimmy Carter described it as an act of reconciliation reuniting the people of the United States and expressing the need to establish the nation's founding principles for all.[394] However, Davis's legacy continued to spark controversy into the twenty-first century. Memorials such as the Jefferson Davis Highway have been argued to legitimize the white supremacist, slaveholding ideology of the Confederacy,[395] and a number of his memorials have been removed, including his statues at the University of Texas at Austin,[396] New Orleans,[397] Memphis, Tennessee,[398] and the Kentucky State Capitol in Frankfort.[399] After the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, Davis's statue on his Richmond monument—along with the statues of other figures who were considered racists—was toppled by protesters.[400] As part of its initiative to dismantle Confederate monuments, the Richmond City Council funded the removal of the statue's pedestal,[401] which was completed in February 2022, and ownership of its artifacts was given to the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia.[402]"", ""On October 17, 1978, Davis's U.S. citizenship was posthumously restored after the Senate passed Joint Resolution 16.

After an unsuccessful candidacy as a United Labor Party (ULP) member in 1899, he was elected as an ""independent liberal"" in a by-election in 1900. He was re-elected in 1902, but defeated in 1905. The following year, he was elected as a ULP candidate, and retained his seat for that party (the Australian Labor Party from 1917) until 1931. Along with the rest of the cabinet, he was ejected from the Australian Labor Party in 1931, and was a member of the Parliamentary Labor Party until his electoral defeat at the hands of a Lang Labor Party candidate in 1933.', ""William Joseph Denny was born in Adelaide, South Australia, on 6 December 1872, one of three children of Thomas Joseph Denny, a publican, and his wife Annie (née Dwyer). He attended Christian Brothers College, Adelaide,[1] then worked as a weather clerk at the General Post Office, Adelaide, under the Postmaster General, Sir Charles Todd.[2] According to a contemporary source, in 1893 he became the editor of the Catholic The Southern Cross newspaper, which published news about and for the Catholic community of South Australia.[3] A more recent source states he commenced as editor of The Southern Cross in 1896.[1] He replaced James O'Loghlin, who later became a United Labor Party (ULP) senator for South Australia.[4] Denny was a councillor of the Adelaide City Council from 1898,[1] representing Grey Ward. During his early twenties he was active in the literary and debating societies of Adelaide, was Chairman of the Christian Brothers Old Collegians Association, and captain of two city rowing clubs.[2] He unsuccessfully contested the two-member seat of West Adelaide in the 1899 South Australian colonial election as a ULP candidate, gaining 27.7 per cent of the vote.[5]"", 'When a by-election was held for West Adelaide on 17 March 1900, Denny was elected to the single vacancy created by the resignation of the former Premier of South Australia, Charles Kingston.[6] He ran as an ""independent liberal"" candidate,[7] gaining 66.8 per cent of the vote.[6] Prior to the 1902 state election the electoral district of West Adelaide was abolished. Denny contested the new four-member electoral district of Adelaide, and was elected second in the count with 14.3 per cent of the votes cast.[8] He was defeated at the 1905 state election, gaining only 9.9 per cent of the votes.[9] The following year, having abandoned his former liberalism,[10] he contested the seat of Adelaide at the state election as a ULP candidate, and was elected first, receiving 19.3 per cent of the votes cast.[11] He was again returned first at the 1910 state election,[12] after which the ULP led by John Verran formed the first Labor government of South Australia on 3 June.[13][14] Having begun studying law at the University of Adelaide in 1903,[1][3] Denny was articled to J.R. Anderson, KC,[15] and was admitted as a solicitor in the Supreme Court of South Australia in 1908.[1]', 'Still serving overseas at the time of the 1918 state election, Denny was returned first of three in Adelaide with 30.2 per cent of the ballots cast.[28] He was repatriated to Australia via the United States on 2 August 1919,[3] returning to his seat. While in the United States, he had been regularly published in the New York Herald.[15] He married Winefride Mary Leahy, a pianist and singer,[1] on 15 January 1920 at St. Ignatius Church, Norwood. His brother, the Reverend Richard Denny, officiated at their wedding.[29] He was elected second of two in 1921 and second of three in 1924 with similar proportions of the vote to that he achieved in 1918.[30] He was appointed Attorney-General in the newly-elected Labor government of John Gunn in April 1924, and was also Minister for Housing, and initially, Assistant Minister for Repatriation. In January 1925 he was appointed as Minister for Irrigation and Minister for Repatriation, while retaining his Attorney-General and housing portfolios.[16]', ""During this period he carried out several significant legislative changes.[1] In 1924, as Minister for Housing, Denny was closely associated with the Thousand Homes Scheme, which aimed to provide affordable housing, particularly for returned soldiers and their families, and lower income groups.[31] The land used for this development was the site of the Mitcham military camp at which Denny had trained before embarking for service overseas.[32] Denny's work on the Scheme resulted in a clash with former Premier Sir Henry Barwell, whom he sued for libel after Barwell made statements suggesting that Denny had made false statements to induce merchants to provide goods and services. Barwell later apologised for his comments.[33]"", 'As a returned soldier, Denny was an exception among Labor politicians at both state and federal level in the 1920s. Willing and able to speak about his personal war experiences, he was one of the few Labor politicians invited to unveil memorials. He performed this role for the Soldiers\' Memorial Hall at Lameroo in 1926, where his ""address was punctuated with applause"". When his political enemies persistently queried the circumstances under which he was awarded the Military Cross, he published the citation in response.[38] Despite Labor\'s loss in the 1927 state election, Denny was returned first of three in the seat of Adelaide, with over 25 per cent of the vote.[39] At the April 1930 state election, he was returned first of three with nearly 82 per cent of the ballots cast.[40] Appointed Attorney-General in the new Labor government of Lionel Hill, Denny was also Minister of Railways, and for the first six months he was also Minister of Local Government.[16] On Anzac Day 1931, acting as Premier in Hill\'s absence, he officiated at the unveiling of the National War Memorial at the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue, Adelaide, before a crowd of about 75,000.[41] As of 1996[update], Denny was one of only a few South Australian ministers to have ever had military experience.[42]', 'In 1931, Denny was expelled from the Labor Party, along with Hill and the rest of the cabinet, for supporting the ""Premiers\' Plan"", which sought to impose austerity measures due to the poor economic conditions. The cabinet formed the Parliamentary Labor Party which continued to govern the state, led by Hill and then by Robert Richards, with the support of the opposition until the 1933 state election. At the 1933 election, Denny lost his seat to a Lang Labor Party candidate.[1]']"

Diefenbaker appointed the first female minister in Canadian history to his cabinet (Ellen Fairclough), as well as the first Indigenous member of the Senate (James Gladstone). During his six years as prime minister, his government obtained passage of the Canadian Bill of Rights and granted the vote to the First Nations and Inuit peoples. In 1962, Diefenbaker's government eliminated racial discrimination in immigration policy. In foreign policy, his stance against apartheid helped secure the departure of South Africa from the Commonwealth of Nations, but his indecision on whether to accept Bomarc nuclear missiles from the United States led to his government's downfall. Diefenbaker is also remembered for his role in the 1959 cancellation of the Avro Arrow project."", 'John Diefenbaker had been interested in politics from an early age and told his mother at the age of eight or nine that he would some day be prime minister. She told him that it was an impossible ambition, especially for a boy living on the prairies.[c] She would live to be proved wrong.[c] John claimed that his first contact with politics came in 1910, when he sold a newspaper to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in Saskatoon to lay the cornerstone for the university\'s first building. The present and future Prime Ministers conversed, and when giving his speech that afternoon, Sir Wilfrid commented on the newsboy who had ended their conversation by saying, ""I can\'t waste any more time on you, Prime Minister. I must get about my work.""[5][d] The authenticity of the meeting was questioned in the 21st century, with an author suggesting that it was invented by Diefenbaker during an election campaign.[6][7]', 'Diefenbaker\'s father, William, was a Liberal; however, John Diefenbaker found himself attracted to the Conservative Party. Free trade was widely popular throughout Western Canada, but Diefenbaker was convinced by the Conservative position that free trade would make Canada an economic dependent of the United States.[23] However, he did not speak publicly of his politics. Diefenbaker recalled in his memoirs that, in 1921, he had been elected as secretary of the Wakaw Liberal Association while absent in Saskatoon, and had returned to find the association\'s records in his office. He promptly returned them to the association president. Diefenbaker also stated that he had been told that if he became a Liberal candidate, ""there was no position in the province which would not be open to him.""[24]', 'The winning candidate, Charles McDonald, did not hold the seat long, resigning it to open a place for the Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, who had been defeated in his Ontario riding. The Tories ran no candidate against King in the by-election on February 15, 1926, and he won easily. Although in the 1925 federal election, the Conservatives had won the greatest number of seats, King continued as Prime Minister with the support of the Progressives. Mackenzie King held office for several months until he finally resigned when the Governor General, Lord Byng, refused a dissolution. Conservative Party leader Arthur Meighen became prime minister, but was quickly defeated in the House of Commons, and Byng finally granted a dissolution of Parliament. Diefenbaker, who had been confirmed as Conservative candidate, stood against King in the 1926 election, a rare direct electoral contest between two individuals who had or would become prime minister. King triumphed easily over Diefenbaker, the Liberals won the federal election, and King regained his position as prime minister.[27]', 'According to Diefenbaker\'s biographer, Denis Smith, the Conservative MP quietly admired Mackenzie King for his political skills.[42] However, Diefenbaker proved a gadfly and an annoyance to Mackenzie King. Angered by the words of Diefenbaker and fellow Conservative MP Howard Green in seeking to censure the government, the Prime Minister referred to Conservative MPs as ""a mob"".[42] When Diefenbaker accompanied two other Conservative leaders to a briefing by Mackenzie King on the war, the Prime Minister exploded at Diefenbaker (a constituent of his), ""What business do you have to be here? You strike me to the heart every time you speak.""[42]', 'The Conservatives elected a floor leader, and in 1941 approached former Prime Minister Meighen, who had been appointed as a senator by Bennett, about becoming party leader again. Meighen agreed, and resigned his Senate seat, but lost a by-election for an Ontario seat in the House of Commons.[43] He remained as leader for several months, although he could not enter the chamber of the House of Commons. Meighen sought to move the Tories to the left, in order to undercut the Liberals and to take support away from the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party (NDP)). To that end, he sought to draft the Liberal-Progressive premier of Manitoba, John Bracken, to lead the Conservatives. Diefenbaker objected to what he saw as an attempt to rig the party\'s choice of new leader[44] and stood for the leadership himself at the party\'s 1942 leadership convention.[45] Bracken was elected on the second ballot; Diefenbaker finished a distant third in both polls. At Bracken\'s request, the convention changed the party\'s name to ""Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.""[46] Bracken chose not to seek entry to the House through a by-election, and when the Conservatives elected a new floor leader, Diefenbaker was defeated by one vote.[47]', ""Bracken was elected to the Commons in the 1945 general election, and for the first time in five years the Tories had their party leader in the House of Commons. The Progressive Conservatives won 67 seats to the Liberals' 125, with smaller parties and independents winning 52 seats. Diefenbaker increased his majority to over 1,000 votes, and had the satisfaction of seeing Mackenzie King defeated in Prince Albert—albeit by a CCF candidate. The Prime Minister was returned in an Ontario by-election within months.[48]"", ""Newman argued that but for Diefenbaker's many defeats, he would never have become Prime Minister:"", 'Diefenbaker ran on a platform which concentrated on changes in domestic policies. He pledged to work with the provinces to reform the Senate. He proposed a vigorous new agricultural policy, seeking to stabilize income for farmers. He sought to reduce dependence on trade with the United States, and to seek closer ties with the United Kingdom.[71] St. Laurent called the Tory platform ""a mere cream-puff of a thing—with more air than substance"".[72] Diefenbaker and the PC party used television adroitly, whereas St. Laurent stated that he was more interested in seeing people than in talking to cameras.[73] Though the Liberals outspent the Progressive Conservatives three to one, according to Newman, their campaign had little imagination, and was based on telling voters that their only real option was to re-elect St. Laurent.[70]', ""When John Diefenbaker took office as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21, 1957, only one Progressive Conservative MP, Earl Rowe, had served in federal governmental office, for a brief period under Bennett in 1935. Rowe was no friend of Diefenbaker — he had briefly served as the party's acting leader in-between Drew's resignation and Diefenbaker's election, and did not definitively rule himself out of running to succeed Drew permanently until a relatively late stage, contributing to Diefenbaker's mistrust of him — and was given no place in his government.[80] Diefenbaker appointed Ellen Fairclough as Secretary of State for Canada, the first woman to be appointed to a Cabinet post, and Michael Starr as Minister of Labour, the first Canadian of Ukrainian descent to serve in Cabinet.[81]"", 'According to the Minister of Finance, Donald Fleming, ""Pearson looked at first merry, then serious, then uncomfortable, then disturbed, and finally sick.""[86] Pearson recorded in his memoirs that the Prime Minister ""tore me to shreds"".[85] Prominent Liberal frontbencher Paul Martin called Diefenbaker\'s response ""one of the greatest devastating speeches"" and ""Diefenbaker\'s great hour"".[88] On February 1, Diefenbaker asked the Governor General, Vincent Massey, to dissolve Parliament, alleging that though St. Laurent had promised cooperation, Pearson had made it clear he would not follow his predecessor\'s lead. Massey agreed to the dissolution, and Diefenbaker set an election date of March 31, 1958.[89][90]', 'Pearson and his Liberals faltered badly in the campaign. The Liberal Party leader tried to make an issue of the fact that Diefenbaker had called a winter election, generally disfavoured in Canada due to travel difficulties. Pearson\'s objection cut little ice with voters, and served only to remind the electorate that the Liberals, at their convention, had called for an election.[97] Pearson mocked Diefenbaker\'s northern plans as ""igloo-to-igloo"" communications, and was assailed by the Prime Minister for being condescending.[98] The Liberal leader spoke to small, quiet crowds, which quickly left the halls when he was done.[97] By election day, Pearson had no illusions that he might win the election, and hoped only to salvage 100 seats. The Liberals would be limited to less than half of that.[97]', 'By the time Diefenbaker called an election for June 18, 1962, the party had been damaged by loss of support in Quebec and in urban areas[112] as voters grew disillusioned with Diefenbaker and the Tories. The PC campaign was hurt when the Bank of Canada was forced to devalue the Canadian dollar to 92+1⁄2\xa0US cents; it had previously hovered in the range from 95\xa0cents to par with the United States dollar. Privately printed satirical ""Diefenbucks"" swept the country.[113] On election day, the Progressive Conservatives lost 92 seats, but were still able to form a minority government. The New Democratic Party (the successor to the CCF) and Social Credit held the balance of power in the new Parliament.[112]', ""Diefenbaker attended a meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly after taking office in 1957. He generated headlines by proposing that 15% of Canadian spending on US imports instead be spent on imports from the United Kingdom.[114] Britain responded with an offer of a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the Canadians.[115] As the Harold Macmillan government in the UK sought to enter the Common Market, Diefenbaker feared that Canadian exports to the UK would be threatened. He also believed that the mother country should place the Commonwealth first, and sought to discourage Britain's entry. The British were annoyed at Canadian interference. Britain's initial attempt to enter the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle.[116]"", ""Diefenbaker attended a meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly after taking office in 1957.

South Africa asked that year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference to allow it to remain in the Commonwealth regardless of the result of the referendum. Diefenbaker privately expressed his distaste for apartheid to South African External Affairs Minister Eric Louw and urged him to give the black and coloured people of South Africa at least the minimal representation they had originally had. Louw, attending the conference as Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd recovered from an assassination attempt, refused.[119] The conference resolved that an advance decision would be interfering in South Africa's internal affairs.[120]"", 'On October 5, 1960, South Africa\'s white voters decided to make the country a republic.[121] At the Prime Ministers\' Conference in 1961, Verwoerd formally applied for South Africa to remain in the Commonwealth. The prime ministers were divided; Diefenbaker broke the deadlock by proposing that South Africa only be re-admitted if it joined other states in condemning apartheid in principle. Once it became clear that South Africa\'s membership would be rejected, Verwoerd withdrew his country\'s application to remain in the Commonwealth and left the group. According to Peter Newman, this was ""Diefenbaker\'s most important contribution to international politics\xa0... Diefenbaker flew home, a hero.""[122]', 'American officials were uncomfortable with Diefenbaker\'s initial election, believing they had heard undertones of anti-Americanism in the campaign. After years of the Liberals, one US State Department official noted, ""We\'ll be dealing with an unknown quantity.""[123] US officials viewed Diefenbaker\'s 1958 landslide with disappointment; they knew and liked Pearson from his years in diplomacy and felt the Liberal Party leader would be more likely to institute pro-American policies.[124] However, US President Dwight Eisenhower took pains to foster good relations with Diefenbaker. The two men found much in common, from Western farm backgrounds to a love of fishing, and Diefenbaker had an admiration for war leaders such as Eisenhower and Churchill.[125] Diefenbaker wrote in his memoirs, ""I might add that President Eisenhower and I were from our first meeting on an \'Ike–John\' basis, and that we were as close as the nearest telephone.""[126] The Eisenhower–Diefenbaker relationship was sufficiently strong that the touchy Canadian Prime Minister was prepared to overlook slights. When Eisenhower addressed Parliament in October 1958, he downplayed trade concerns that Diefenbaker had publicly expressed. Diefenbaker said nothing and took Eisenhower fishing.[127]', 'Diefenbaker had approved plans to join the United States in what became known as NORAD, an integrated air defence system, in mid-1957.[128] Despite Liberal misgivings that Diefenbaker had committed Canada to the system before consulting either the Cabinet or Parliament, Pearson and his followers voted with the government to approve NORAD in June 1958.[129]', 'In 1959, the Diefenbaker government cancelled the development and manufacture of the Avro CF-105 Arrow. The Arrow was a supersonic jet interceptor built by Avro Canada in Malton, Ontario, to defend Canada in the event of a Soviet attack. The interceptor had been under development since 1953, and had suffered from many cost overruns and complications.[130] In 1955, the RCAF stated it would need only nine squadrons of Arrows, down from 20, as originally proposed.[130] According to C. D. Howe, the former minister responsible for postwar reconstruction, the St. Laurent government had serious misgivings about continuing the Arrow program, and planned to discuss its termination after the 1957 election.[131] In the run-up to the 1958 election, with three Tory-held seats at risk in the Malton area, the Diefenbaker government authorized further funding.[132] Even though the first test flights of the Arrow were successful, the US government was unwilling to commit to a purchase of aircraft from Canada.[133] In September 1958, Diefenbaker warned[134] that the Arrow would come under complete review in six months.[135] The company began seeking out other projects including a US-funded ""saucer"" program that became the VZ-9 Avrocar, and also mounted a public relations offensive urging that the Arrow go into full production.[136] On February 20, 1959, the Cabinet decided to cancel the Avro Arrow, following an earlier decision to permit the United States to build two Bomarc missile bases in Canada. The company immediately dismissed its 14,000 employees, blaming Diefenbaker for the firings, though it rehired 2,500 employees to fulfil existing obligations.[g]', ""Diefenbaker was initially inclined to go along with Kennedy's request that nuclear weapons be stationed on Canadian soil as part of NORAD. However, when an August 3, 1961, letter from Kennedy which urged this was leaked to the media, Diefenbaker was angered and withdrew his support. The Prime Minister was also influenced by a massive demonstration against nuclear weapons, which took place on Parliament Hill. Diefenbaker was handed a petition containing 142,000 names.[145]"", ""By 1962, the American government was becoming increasingly concerned at the lack of a commitment from Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices.[146] Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads.[147] Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House for a dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes.[148] When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign.[149] Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind.[150] Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.[151]"", ""When the Cuban Missile Crisis erupted in October 1962, Kennedy chose not to consult with Diefenbaker before making decisions on what actions to take. The US president sent former Ambassador Merchant to Ottawa to inform the Prime Minister as to the content of the speech that Kennedy was to make on television. Diefenbaker was upset at both the lack of consultation and the fact that he was given less than two hours advance word.[154] He was angered again when the US government released a statement stating that it had Canada's full support.[155] In a statement to the Commons, Diefenbaker proposed sending representatives of neutral nations to Cuba to verify the American allegations, which Washington took to mean that he was questioning Kennedy's word.[156] When American forces went to a heightened alert, DEFCON 3, Diefenbaker was slow to order Canadian forces to match it. Harkness and the Chiefs of Staff had Canadian forces clandestinely go to that alert status anyway,[157] and Diefenbaker eventually authorized it.[158] The crisis ended without war, and polls found that Kennedy's actions were widely supported by Canadians. Diefenbaker was severely criticized in the media.[159]"", 'The bitter divisions within the Cabinet continued, with Diefenbaker deliberating whether to call an election on the issue of American interference in Canadian politics. At least six Cabinet ministers favoured Diefenbaker\'s ouster. Finally, at a dramatic Cabinet meeting on Sunday, February 3, Harkness told Diefenbaker that the Prime Minister no longer had the confidence of the Canadian people, and resigned. Diefenbaker asked ministers supporting him to stand, and when only about half did, stated that he was going to see the Governor General to resign, and that Fleming would be the next Prime Minister. Green called his Cabinet colleagues a ""nest of traitors"", but eventually cooler heads prevailed, and the Prime Minister was urged to return and to fight the motion of non-confidence scheduled for the following day. Harkness, however, persisted in his resignation.[165] Negotiations with the Social Credit Party, which had enough votes to save the government, failed, and the government fell, 142–111.[166]', 'Diefenbaker was embittered by his loss of the party leadership. Pearson announced his retirement in December 1967, and Diefenbaker forged a wary relationship of mutual respect with Pearson\'s successor, Pierre Trudeau. Trudeau called a general election for June 1968; Stanfield asked Diefenbaker to join him at a rally in Saskatoon, which Diefenbaker refused, although the two appeared at hastily arranged photo opportunities. Trudeau obtained the majority against Stanfield that Pearson had never been able to obtain against Diefenbaker, as the PC party lost 25 seats, 20 of them in the West. The former Prime Minister, though stating, ""The Conservative Party has suffered a calamitous disaster"" in a CBC interview, could not conceal his delight at Stanfield\'s humiliation, and especially gloated at the defeat of Camp, who made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the Commons.[183] Diefenbaker was easily returned for Prince Albert.[183]', 'Diefenbaker had extensively planned his funeral in consultation with government officials. He lay in state in the Hall of Honour in Parliament for two and a half days; 10,000 Canadians passed by his casket. The Maple Leaf Flag on the casket was partially obscured by the Red Ensign.[193][194] After the service, his body was taken by train on a slow journey to its final destination, Saskatoon; along the route, many Canadians lined the tracks to watch the funeral train pass. In Winnipeg, an estimated 10,000 people waited at midnight in a one-kilometre line to file past the casket which made the trip draped in a Canadian flag and Diefenbaker\'s beloved Red Ensign.[195] In Prince Albert, thousands of those he had represented filled the square in front of the railroad station to salute the only man from Saskatchewan ever to become Prime Minister. His coffin was accompanied by that of his wife Olive, disinterred from temporary burial in Ottawa. Prime Minister Clark delivered the eulogy, paying tribute to ""an indomitable man, born to a minority group, raised in a minority region, leader of a minority party, who went on to change the very nature of his country, and change it forever"".[193] John and Olive Diefenbaker rest outside the Diefenbaker Centre, built to house his papers, on the campus of the University of Saskatchewan.[193][196]', 'Conservative Senator Marjory LeBreton worked in Diefenbaker\'s office during his second time as Opposition Leader, and has said of him, ""He brought a lot of firsts to Canada, but a lot of it has been air-brushed from history by those who followed.""[204] Historian Michael Bliss, who published a survey of the Canadian Prime Ministers, wrote of Diefenbaker:']"

He played a central role in the creation of the modern Conservative Party, defining its policies and its broad outreach. Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the Liberal Party leader William Ewart Gladstone, and his one-nation conservatism or ""Tory democracy"". He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the British Empire and military action to expand it, both of which were popular among British voters. He is the only British Prime Minister to have been born Jewish.', 'Disraeli was born in Bloomsbury, then a part of Middlesex. His father left Judaism after a dispute at his synagogue; Benjamin became an Anglican at the age of 12. After several unsuccessful attempts, Disraeli entered the House of Commons in 1837. In 1846, Prime Minister Robert Peel split the party over his proposal to repeal the Corn Laws, which involved ending the tariff on imported grain. Disraeli clashed with Peel in the House of Commons, becoming a major figure in the party. When Lord Derby, the party leader, thrice formed governments in the 1850s and 1860s, Disraeli served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons.', 'At the end of June 1851, Stanley succeeded to the title of Earl of Derby.[118] The Whigs were wracked by internal dissensions during the second half of 1851, much of which Parliament spent in recess. Russell dismissed Lord Palmerston from the cabinet, leaving the latter determined to deprive the Prime Minister of office. Palmerston did so within weeks of Parliament\'s reassembly on 4 February 1852, his followers combining with Disraeli\'s Tories to defeat the government on a Militia Bill, and Russell resigned. Derby had either to take office or risk damage to his reputation,[119] and he accepted the Queen\'s commission as prime minister. Palmerston declined any office; Derby had hoped to have him as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Disraeli, his closest ally, was his second choice and accepted, though disclaiming any great knowledge in the financial field. Gladstone refused to join the government.[120] Disraeli may have been attracted to the office by the £5,000 annual salary, which would help pay his debts.[121] Few of the new cabinet had held office before; when Derby tried to inform the Duke of Wellington of the names of the ministers, the old Duke, who was somewhat deaf, inadvertently branded the new government by incredulously repeating ""Who? Who?""[119]', 'Derby had long had attacks of gout which left him bedbound, unable to deal with politics. As the new session of Parliament approached in February 1868, he was unable to leave his home but was reluctant to resign, as at 68 he was much younger than either Palmerston or Russell at the end of their premierships. Derby knew that his ""attacks of illness would, at no distant period, incapacitate me from the discharge of my public duties""; doctors had warned him that his health required his resignation.[160] In late February, with Parliament in session and Derby absent, he wrote to Disraeli asking for confirmation that ""you will not shrink from the additional heavy responsibility"".[161] Reassured, he wrote to the Queen, resigning and recommending Disraeli as ""only he could command the cordial support, en masse, of his present colleagues"".[161] Disraeli went to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, where the Queen asked him to form a government. The monarch wrote to her daughter, Prussian Crown Princess Victoria, ""Mr. Disraeli is Prime Minister! A proud thing for a man \'risen from the people\' to have obtained!""[161] The new prime minister told those who came to congratulate him, ""I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole.""[162]', ""Disraeli sent the Liberal MP Nathan Rothschild to Paris to enquire about buying de Lesseps's shares.[194] On 14 November 1875, the editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, Frederick Greenwood, learnt from London banker Henry Oppenheim that the Khedive was seeking to sell his shares in the Suez Canal Company to a French firm. Greenwood quickly told Lord Derby, the Foreign Secretary, who notified Disraeli. The Prime Minister moved immediately to secure the shares. On 23 November, the Khedive offered to sell the shares for 100,000,000 francs.[197] Rather than seek the aid of the Bank of England, Disraeli borrowed funds from Lionel de Rothschild, who took a commission on the deal. The banker's capital was at risk as Parliament could have refused to ratify the transaction.[198] The contract for purchase was signed at Cairo on 25 November and the shares deposited at the British consulate the following day.[197][199]"", 'Parliament opened in February 1877, with Disraeli now in the Lords as Earl of Beaconsfield. He spoke only once there in the 1877 session on the Eastern Question, stating on 20 February that there was a need for stability in the Balkans, and that forcing Turkey into territorial concessions would not secure it. The Prime Minister wanted a deal with the Ottomans whereby Britain would temporarily occupy strategic areas to deter the Russians from war, to be returned on the signing of a peace treaty, but found little support in his cabinet, which favoured partition of the Ottoman Empire. As Disraeli, by then in poor health, continued to battle within the cabinet, Russia invaded Turkey on 21 April, beginning the Russo-Turkish War.[219]', 'As successful invasions of India generally came through Afghanistan, the British had observed and sometimes intervened there since the 1830s, hoping to keep the Russians out. In 1878 the Russians sent a mission to Kabul; it was not rejected by the Afghans, as the British had hoped. The British proposed to send their own mission, insisting that the Russians be sent away. The Viceroy of India Lord Lytton concealed his plans to issue this ultimatum from Disraeli, and when the Prime Minister insisted he take no action, went ahead anyway. When the Afghans made no answer, Lord Cranbrook as Secretary of State for War, ordered the advance against them in the Second Anglo-Afghan War.[236] Under Lord Roberts, the British easily defeated them and installed a new ruler, leaving a mission and garrison in Kabul.[237]', ""Disraeli's health continued to fail through 1879. Owing to his infirmities, Disraeli was 45 minutes late for the Lord Mayor's Dinner at the Guildhall in November, at which it is customary that the Prime Minister speaks. Though many commented on how healthy he looked, it took him great effort to appear so, and when he told the audience he expected to speak to the dinner again the following year, attendees chuckled. Gladstone was then in the midst of his campaign. Despite his public confidence, Disraeli recognised that the Conservatives would probably lose the next election and was already contemplating his Resignation Honours.[244]"", 'Disraeli refused to cast blame for the defeat, which he understood was likely to be final for him. He wrote to Lady Bradford that it was just as much work to end a government as to form one, without any of the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure. Among the honours he arranged before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, Montagu Corry, who became Baron Rowton.[250]', 'Despite the gravity of Disraeli\'s condition, the doctors concocted optimistic bulletins for public consumption. Prime Minister Gladstone called several times to enquire about his rival\'s condition, and wrote in his diary, ""May the Almighty be near his pillow.""[255] There was intense public interest in Disraeli\'s struggles for life. Disraeli had customarily taken the sacrament at Easter; when this day was observed on 17 April, there was discussion among his friends and family if he should be given the opportunity, but those against, fearing that he would lose hope, prevailed.[256] On the morning of the following day, Easter Monday, he became incoherent, then comatose.[257] Disraeli\'s last confirmed words before dying at his home at 19 Curzon Street in the early morning of 19 April were ""I had rather live but I am not afraid to die"".[258][259][n 24] The anniversary of Disraeli\'s death was for some years commemorated in the United Kingdom as Primrose Day.', ""John Gielgud portrayed Disraeli in 1941, in Thorold Dickinson's morale-boosting film The Prime Minister, which followed the politician from age 30 to 70.""]"

Djedkare succeeded Menkauhor Kaiu and was in turn succeeded by Unas. His relationship to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain, although it is often conjectured that Unas was Djedkare's son, owing to the smooth transition between the two."", 'Djedkare is believed to have been buried in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare (""Djedkare is perfect""), which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity. When excavated in the 1940s, the burial chamber contained mummified skeletal remains thought to belong to Djedkare. Examinations of the mummy revealed the individual died in his fifties. A clue to the identity of the remains came from skeletal and blood type comparisons with those of two females thought to be Djedkare\'s daughters buried in the nearby Southern Cemetery as Abusir. Radio carbon dating carried out on the effects of the three individuals revealed a common range of 2886-2507 BC, some 160–390 years older than the accepted chronology of the 5th Dynasty.[17]', 'After his death, Djedkare was the object of a cult that lasted at least until the end of the Old Kingdom. He seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during the mid-Sixth Dynasty, whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later New Kingdom (c. 1550–1077 BC). Djedkare was also remembered by the ancient Egyptians as the Pharaoh of Vizier Ptahhotep, the purported author of The Maxims of Ptahhotep, one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature.', 'In addition to these sources, Djedkare is mentioned on the Prisse Papyrus dating to the 12th Dynasty (c.\u20091990–1800 BC).[34] The papyrus records The Maxims of Ptahhotep and gives Djedkare\'s nomen ""Isesi"" to name the pharaoh whom the purported authors of the maxims, vizier Ptahhotep, served.[35]\nDjedkare was also probably mentioned in the Aegyptiaca, a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is known to us only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. Africanus relates that a pharaoh Tancheres (Ancient Greek Τανχέρης) reigned for 44 years as the eighth and penultimate king of the Fifth Dynasty.[36] Given its position within the dynasty, Tancheres is believed to be his Hellenized name.[31]', 'The relative chronological position of Djedkare as the eighth and penultimate ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, succeeding Menkauhor Kaiu and preceding Unas on the throne, is well established by historical sources and confirmed by archaeological evidence.[82]', 'One of the Abusir papyri was found to be dated to the ""Year of the 22nd Count, IV Akhet day 12"", constituting Djedkare\'s latest known date.[note 16][88] This date might correspond to any time from the 32nd year of Djedkare\'s reign up to his 44th year on the throne, depending on whether the cattle count was once every two years or once every year and a half. The higher estimate is close to Manetho\'s 44-year figure credited to Tancheres,[89] the Hellenized name of Djedkare, although this may just be coincidental.[90] Modern estimates thus put Djedkare\'s reign length as certainly more than 33 years and, if the cattle count was regularly biennial, at least 42 to 44 years.[90] This makes Djedkare the longest reigning king of the Fifth Dynasty.[12]', ""The reign of Djedkare heralded a new period in the history of the Old Kingdom.[92][93] First, he did not build a sun temple, as his predecessors had done since the time of Userkaf, some 80 years earlier.[note 17][94][95] This may be a result of the increased prominence of Osiris compared with the sun god Ra during the late Fifth Dynasty.[1][96][97][98] The rise of Osiris corresponds to changes in the role of the king with respect to the wider Egyptian society. In particular, the king loses his role as the sole guarantor of the afterlife, which now becomes available beyond the immediate royal circle. These changes demythologise the king's position and, as the Egyptologist Hans Goedicke writes, make him fully human yet still socially dominant.[99]\nThe importance of the cult of Osiris becomes manifest when the Pyramid Texts of the pyramid of Unas are inscribed a few decades later.[96][100] In this context, it is perhaps noteworthy that the only[101] known statue of Djedkare was discovered in the ruins of the temple of Osiris, in Abydos.[91] Another manifestation of the winds of change[102] during Djedkare's time on the throne is the confirmation of the relocation of the royal necropolis from Abusir, where it had been since the reign of Sahure, to Saqqara, where Menkauhor Kaiu, Djedkare and his successor, Unas, built their pyramids. Abusir may have become overcrowded by the time of Menkauhor's accession[103] and the capital may have been shifted south to Saqqara, along with the royal necropolis, around the same time.[104] The abandonment of Abusir as a royal necropolis and the termination of sun temple building are possibly related, given the close association between the two since the reign of Userkaf.[105]"", 'During his reign Djedkare effected significant reforms of the state administration and priesthood, in particular that pertaining to the funerary cults[107] in the necropolis of Abusir.[note 18][108]\nThese evolutions are witnessed by changes in priestly titles and more broadly, in the system of ranking titles of high officials, which was modified for the first time in its existence.[94] For example, the priesthood of the royal pyramids was reorganized,[1] with Djedkare possibly changing the titles and functions of the priests from ""priest of king"" to ""priest of the pyramid"",[109] although this change may have happened earlier, under Nyuserre Ini.[110]\nPrinces of royal blood could once more hold administrative titles,[note 19] a prerogative they had lost during the early Fifth Dynasty.[94] At the same time, viziers could now hold the prestigious titles of Iry-pat[93] and Haty-a[111] and, as ""overseer of the royal scribes"", became the head of the scribal administration.[112] At least one vizier, Seshemnefer III, even bore the title of ""king\'s son of his body"", one of the most distinguished titles at the time and normally reserved to princes of royal blood. Yet neither Seshemnefer III\'s father nor his mother seems to have belonged to the royal family.[113] For the period spanning the reign of Djedkare until that of Teti, viziers were furthermore responsible for the weaponry of the state, both for military and other purposes.[113] Following the reforms undertaken by Djedkare, three viziers would be in office at the same time:[114] two in the Memphite region and a Southern one, the ""governor of Upper Egypt"",[94] with a seat at Abydos.[1][2] In total six viziers were appointed during Djedkare\'s reign.[note 20][106]', 'Lower ranking officials lost power during the late Fifth Dynasty and were frequently limited to holding only one high title,[114] a departure from the preceding period.[94] Such functions as ""overseer of the granary"" and ""overseer of the treasury"" disappear from the record some time between Djedkare\'s reign and that of Teti,[94] while men of lower status became head of the legal administration.[112] Consequently, the viziers concentrated more power than before while lower echelons of the state administration were reduced.[112] At the same time, the size of the provincial administration was increased, and it also became more autonomous from the central government.[2] In particular, the nomarchs were responsible in their provinces for performing works hitherto conducted by Memphite officials.[112]', 'Three or four[note 23] rock inscriptions dating to Djedkare\'s reign have been found in the Wadi Maghareh in Sinai, where mines of copper and semi-precious stones were exploited throughout the Old Kingdom, from the Fourth until the Sixth Dynasty.[134] These inscriptions record three expeditions sent to look for turquoise: the earliest one, dated to the third[135] or fourth[136] cattle count–possibly corresponding to the sixth or eighth year of Dejdkare\'s reign–explicitly recalls the arrival of the mining party to the ""hills of the turquoise""[note 24] after being given ""divine authority for the finding of semi-precious stones in the writing of the god himself, [as was enacted] in the broad court of the temple Nekhenre"".[135][136] This sentence could indicate the earliest known record of an oracular divination undertaken in order to ensure the success of the expedition prior to its departure, Nekhenre being the sun temple of Userkaf.[136]\nAnother inscription dating to the year of the ninth cattle count–possibly Djedkare\'s 18th year on the throne\xa0– shows the king ""subduing all foreign lands. Smiting the chief of the foreign land"".[135][136] The expedition that left this inscription comprised over 1400 men and administration officials.[138][139] Some Egyptologists have proposed that these men were also sent to mine copper.[140][141]', 'South of Egypt, Djedkare dispatched at least one expedition to the diorite quarries located 65\xa0km (40\xa0mi) north-west of Abu Simbel.[note 25][148] Djedkare was not the first king to do so, as these quarries were already exploited during the Fourth Dynasty and continued to be so during the Sixth Dynasty and later, in the Middle Kingdom period (c.\u20092055 BC\xa0– c.\u20091650 BC).[147]', ""Egypt entertained continuing trade relations with the Levant during Djedkare's reign, possibly as far north as Anatolia. A gold cylinder seal bearing the serekh of Djedkare together with the cartouche of Menkauhor Kaiu is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[note 27][146] The seal, whose gold may originate from the Pactolus river valley in western Anatolia,[151] could attest to wide-ranging trade-contacts during the later Fifth Dynasty,[2][152] but its provenance remains unverifiable.[note 28][155]"", 'Trade contacts with Byblos, on the coast of modern-day Lebanon, are suggested by a fragmentary stone vessel unearthed in the city and bearing the inscription ""King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Djedkare [living] forever"".[156][157] A biographical inscription discovered in the tomb of Iny, a Sixth Dynasty official, provides further evidence for an Egyptian expedition to Byblos during Djedkare\'s reign.[158] Iny\'s inscription relates his travels to procure lapis lazuli and lead or tin[159] for pharaoh Merenre, but starts by recounting what must have been similar events taking place under Djedkare.[160]', ""Not all relations between Egypt and its neighbors were peaceful during Djedkare's reign. In particular, one of the earliest known depictions of a battle or a city being besieged[165] is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the 21st nome of Upper Egypt, who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty.[158][165] The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a Near Eastern fortress on ladders.[31][166] More generally, ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in Canaan during the later Old Kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there.[167]"", 'For Nigel Strudwick, the reforms of Djedkare were undertaken as a reaction to the rapid growth of the central administration in the first part of the Fifth Dynasty[112] which, Baer adds, had amassed too much political or economic power[174] in the eyes of the king.[175] Joyce Tyldesley sees the reign of Djedkare as the very beginning of a decline in the importance of the king, in conjunction with the gradual rise of the power wielded by the high and provincial administration.[176] Concurrent with this trend is a process of decentralization, with local loyalties slowly superseding allegiance to the central state.[176] Since offices and the vizierate in particular could be inherited,[2] the reforms of Djedkare created a ""virtual feudal system"" as Nicolas Grimal writes,[148][177] with much power in the hands of a few puissant officials. This is best witnessed by the large, magnificent mastaba tombs that Djedkare\'s viziers built.[148] In this context, Djedkare\'s reforms of the ranking system might have been an attempt at maintaining a sprawling administration under control,[114] yet ultimately failed. For some Egyptologists, such as Naguib Kanawati, this failure contributed in no small part to the fall of the Old Kingdom,[178] but others, including Strudwick, believe the reasons of the collapse must be sought elsewhere as the power of an administration official never approached that of the king.[174]', 'Djedkare seems to have been held in high esteem during the Sixth Dynasty. For example, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare.[184] In addition, the South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his successor Pepi II,[185] records rich offerings being made to Djedkare on behalf of the king.[note 43][186][187] An estimated 92%[188] of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate (c.\u20092160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period (c.\u20092055–1650 BC).[189]', 'For the later New Kingdom, a relief from the Saqqara tomb of the priest Mehu, dating to the 19th or 20th Dynasty shows three gods faced by several deceased pharaohs. These are Djoser and Sekhemket, of the Third Dynasty and Userkaf, founder of the Fifth Dynasty. He is followed by a fourth king whose name is damaged but which is often read ""Djedkare"" or, much less likely, ""Shepseskare"". The relief is an expression of personal piety on Mehu\'s behalf, who prayed to the ancient kings for them to recommend him to the gods.[192]']"

As his son Prabowo Subianto joined the military and married Suharto's daughter, Sumitro also continued to work as an economist with some influence during the 1980s. In the leadup to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, he began to call for greater deregulation of the economy but remained committed to the political structure of the New Order. Following his death, his children and grandchildren remain influential in Indonesian politics, with his son Prabowo Subianto being elected as President of Indonesia."", ""He joined the newly formed government of the Republic of Indonesia which had declared itself independent from Dutch colonial rule with Sukarno as president. Sumitro became an assistant to Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir and later worked at the Ministry of Finance.[20] By this time Dutch forces under the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration had returned to Indonesia to retake control, but they had managed to hold only several coastal cities at first.[21] In late June 1946 Sumitro was part of Sjahrir's entourage in Surakarta when the group was kidnapped by disgruntled army units led by major general Sudarsono, commander of a division within the Indonesian Army.[22] During the political wrangling and coup attempt that followed, the group was relocated to Yogyakarta; their kidnappers planned to force Sukarno to remove Sjahrir and appoint a new cabinet, as Sudarsono considered Sjahrir's diplomatic approaches to the Dutch to be too lenient. Due to a botched attempt to kidnap another minister, Amir Sjarifuddin, most of Sudarsono's soldiers failed to show up to Sukarno's palace, only the prisoners and a handful of troops being there with Sudarsono. Sukarno refused the demands, Sudarsono was arrested, and Sjahrir along with his group were released.[22][23]"", 'During the final negotiations on the handover of Indonesian sovereignty Sumitro led the economic and financial subcommittee. In these negotiations, while the Dutch calculated that the Indonesians would have to take on debt passed on from the Dutch East Indies government amounting to over 6\xa0billion guilders, Sumitro argued the opposite: that a significant proportion of the debts (around 2\xa0billion guilders) were created to fund the Dutch effort against Indonesian forces during the revolution and hence should not be paid by the Indonesian government. Instead, he calculated that the Dutch government would owe Indonesia 500\xa0million guilders. The Dutch eventually agreed to not include the military spending, and an agreement was struck that the Indonesian government would be responsible for 4.3\xa0billion guilders in debt (then equivalent to US$1.13\xa0billion) to be paid in full by July 1964.[32][33][34] Sumitro wanted to negotiate down the debt further, but was overridden by Vice-President Mohammad Hatta.[35] Sumitro also opposed deferring the question on sovereignty over Western New Guinea, but was again overridden by Hatta.[36]', ""Two of Sumitro's brothers, Subianto and Subandio, were active in the Indonesian youth movement and were both killed during the Lengkong incident of 1946.[160] He married Dora Marie Sigar, whom he had met during his time in the Netherlands, on 7 January 1947.

Donaldson had compiled a break of 104.[49] Donaldson recorded another century break of 106 in the twentieth frame, but Davis increased his lead over him to 14–10 by the end of the second day.[50] On the third day, Davis achieved a break of 140, a new World Championship record, and Donaldson made a 111. Davis finished the day 21–15 ahead.[51] After another day's play, Davis was 29–19 ahead,[52] after which Donaldson won eight of the next twelve frames.[53] Davis won the title, finishing the last day at 38–35.[54]"", ""The 1952/1953 News of the World Snooker Tournament finished in January 1953, with Donaldson's three wins in eight matches enough to see him finish third.[55] The 1953 World Professional Match-play Championship final in March saw Donaldson and Davis even at 6–6 after the first day of the 71-frame match. Donaldson took a 13–11 lead after day two, despite a break of 107 by Davis.[56][57] Donaldson was ahead 20–16 after day three, but Davis tied the match at 24–24 after the fourth day which included a century of 102.[58] Davis led 28–26, but Donaldson took a 31–29 lead at the end of the fifth day.[59] The match was again level at 33–33 after the final afternoon session, before Davis won 37–34.[60]"", 'Donaldson placed seventh in the 1953/1954 News of the World Snooker Tournament, having lost five of his eight matches.[61] In the 1954 World Professional Match-play Championship, Fred Davis and Donaldson met in their eighth successive final. It was the most one-sided of the finals, with Davis leading 33–15 after four days in the 71-frame contest. Even before losing the match, Donaldson said he would not enter the World Championship again because he could not give enough time to the practice he felt was necessary.[62] Davis secured victory by winning the first three frames on the fifth day to lead 36–15.[63] The final score was 45–26 with Donaldson making a break of 121 on the final day.[64]', 'Donaldson placed seventh in the 1953/1954 News of the World Snooker Tournament, having lost five of his eight matches.[61] In the 1954 World Professional Match-play Championship, Fred Davis and Donaldson met in their eighth successive final.

His father, Gille-Brighde of Galloway, and his uncle, Uhtred of Galloway, were the two rival sons of Fergus, Prince or Lord of Galloway. As a result of Gille-Brighde's conflict with Uhtred and the Scottish monarch William the Lion, Donnchadh became a hostage of King Henry II of England. He probably remained in England for almost a decade before returning north on the death of his father. Although denied succession to all the lands of Galloway, he was granted lordship over Carrick in the north."", 'The rest of the region was settled by the people called Gall-Gaidhil (modern Scottish Gaelic: Gall-Ghàidheil) in their own language, variations of Gallwedienses in Latin, and normally Galwegians or Gallovidians in modern English.[22] References in the 11th century to the kingdom of the Gall-Gaidhil centre it far to the north of what is now Galloway.[23] Kingarth (Cenn Garadh) and Eigg (Eic) were described as ""in Galloway"" (Gallgaidelaib) by the Martyrology of Óengus, in contrast to Whithorn\xa0—part of modern Galloway—which was named as lying within another kingdom, The Rhinns (Na Renna).[24] These areas had been part of the Kingdom of Northumbria until the 9th century, and afterward were transformed by a process very poorly documented, but probably carried out by numerous small bands of culturally Scandinavian but linguistically Gaelic warrior-settlers moving in from Ireland and southern Argyll.[25] ""Galloway"" today only refers to the lands of Rhinns, Farines, Glenken, Desnes Mór and Desnes Ioan (that is, Wigtownshire and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright), but this is due to the territorial changes that took place in and around Donnchadh\'s lifetime rather than being the contemporary definition.[26] For instance, a 12th-century piece of marginalia located the island of Ailsa Craig ""lying between Gallgaedelu [Galloway] and Cend Tiri [Kintyre]"", while a charter of Máel Coluim IV (""Malcolm IV"") describes Strathgryfe, Cunningham, Kyle and Carrick as the four cadrez (probably from ceathramh, ""quarter""s) of Galloway; an Irish annal entry for the year 1154 designated galleys from Arran, Kintyre, the Isle of Man as Gallghaoidhel, ""Galwegian"".[27]', ""When Donnchadh adopted or was given the title of earl (Latin: comes), or in his own language mormaer, is a debated question. Historian Alan Orr Anderson argued that he began using the title of comes between 1214 and 1216, based on Donnchadh's appearance as a witness to two charters issued by Thomas de Colville; the first, known as Melrose 193 (this being its number in Cosmo Innes's printed version of the cartulary), was dated by Anderson to 1214.[63] In this charter, Donnchadh has no title.[63] By contrast Donnchadh was styled comes in a charter dated by Anderson to 1216, Melrose 192.[64]"", 'Carrick was located in the Firth of Clyde, in the Irish Sea region far from the main centres of Scottish and Anglo-Norman influence lying to its east and south-east. Carrick was separated from Kyle in the north and north-east by the River Doon, and from Galloway proper by Glenapp and by the adjacent hills and forests.[69] There were three main rivers, the Doon, the Girvan and the Stinchar, though most of the province was hilly, meaning that most wealth came from animal husbandry rather than arable farming.[69] The population of Carrick, like that in neighbouring Galloway, consisted of kin groups governed by a ""chief"" or ""captain"" (cenn, Latin capitaneus).[70] Above these captains was the Cenn Cineoil (""kenkynolle""), the ""kin-captain"" of Carrick, a position held by the mormaer; it was not until after Donnchadh\'s death that these two positions were separated.[71] The best-recorded groups are Donnchadh\'s own group (known only as de Carrick, ""of Carrick"") and the Mac Cennétig (Kennedy) family, who seem to have provided the earldom\'s hereditary stewards.[72]', ""The population was governed under these leaders by a customary law that remained distinct from the common law of Scotland for the remainder of the Middle Ages.[73] One documented aspect of Carrick and Galloway law was the power of sergeants (an original Gaelic word Latinised as Kethres),[74] officials of the earl or of other captains, to claim one night of free hospitality (a privilege called sorryn et frithalos), and to accuse and arrest with little restriction.[75] The personal demesne, or lands, of the earl was probably extensive in Donnchadh's time; in 1260, during the minority of Donnchadh's descendant Countess Marjory of Carrick, an assessment made by the Scottish king showed that the earls had estates throughout the province, in upland locations like Straiton, Glengennet and Bennan, as well as in the east in locations such as Turnberry and Dalquharran.[76]""]"

In 1940 Dunglass was diagnosed with spinal tuberculosis and was immobilised for two years. By the later stages of the war he had recovered enough to resume his political career, but he lost his seat in the general election of 1945. He regained it in 1950, but the following year he left the Commons when, on the death of his father, he inherited the earldom of Home and thereby became a member of the House of Lords. Under the premierships of Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan he was appointed to a series of increasingly senior posts, including Leader of the House of Lords and Foreign Secretary. In the latter post, which he held from 1960 to 1963, he supported United States resolve in the Cuban Missile Crisis and in August 1963 was the United Kingdom's signatory to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty."", '[A] votary of the esoteric Eton religion, the kind of graceful, tolerant, sleepy boy who is showered with favours and crowned with all the laurels, who is liked by the masters and admired by the boys without any apparent exertion on his part, without experiencing the ill-effects of success himself or arousing the pangs of envy in others. In the 18th century he would have become Prime Minister before he was 30. As it was, he appeared honourably ineligible for the struggle of life.[4]', 'Dunglass was a talented sportsman. In addition to representing Eton at fives,[6] he was a capable cricketer at school, club and county level, and was unique among British prime ministers in having played first-class cricket.[7] Coached by George Hirst,[8] he became in Wisden\'s phrase ""a useful member of the Eton\xa0XI""[7] that included Percy Lawrie and Gubby Allen.[9] Wisden observed, ""In the rain-affected Eton-Harrow match of 1922 he scored 66, despite being hindered by a saturated outfield, and then took 4 for 37 with his medium-paced out-swingers"".[7] At first-class level he represented the Oxford University Cricket Club, Middlesex County Cricket Club and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Between 1924 and 1927 he played ten first-class matches, scoring 147 runs at an average of 16.33 with a best score of 37 not out. As a bowler he took 12 wickets at an average of 30.25 with a best of 3 for 43. Three of his first-class games were internationals against Argentina on the MCC ""representative"" tour of South America in 1926–27.[7]', 'As Chamberlain\'s aide Dunglass witnessed at first-hand the Prime Minister\'s attempts to prevent a second world war through appeasement of Adolf Hitler\'s Germany. When Chamberlain had his final meeting with Hitler at Munich in September 1938, Dunglass accompanied him. Having gained a short-lived extension of peace by acceding to Hitler\'s territorial demands at the expense of Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain was welcomed back to London by cheering crowds. Ignoring Dunglass\'s urging he made an uncharacteristically grandiloquent speech, claiming to have brought back ""Peace with Honour"" and promising ""peace for our time"".[31] These words were to haunt him when Hitler\'s continued aggression made war unavoidable less than a year later. Chamberlain remained prime minister from the outbreak of war in September 1939 until May 1940, when, in Dunglass\'s words, ""he could no longer command support of a majority in the Conservative party"".[32] After a vote in the Commons, in which the government\'s majority fell from more than 200 to 81, Chamberlain made way for Winston Churchill. He accepted the non-departmental post of Lord President of the Council in the new coalition government; Dunglass remained as his PPS,[29] having earlier declined the offer of a ministerial post as Under-secretary at the Scottish Office.[33] Although Chamberlain\'s reputation never recovered from Munich, and his supporters such as R. A. Butler suffered throughout their later careers from the ""appeasement"" tag, Dunglass largely escaped blame.[n 2] Nevertheless, Dunglass firmly maintained all his life that the Munich agreement had been vital to the survival of Britain and the defeat of Nazi Germany by giving the UK an extra year to prepare for a war that it could not have contested in 1938.[29] Within months of his leaving the premiership Chamberlain\'s health began to fail; he resigned from the cabinet, and died after a short illness in November 1940.', 'Home was appointed to the new post of Minister of State at the Scottish Office, a middle-ranking position, senior to Under-secretary but junior to James Stuart, the Secretary of State, who was a member of the cabinet. Stuart, previously an influential chief whip, was a confidant of Churchill, and possibly the most powerful Scottish Secretary in any government.[49] Thorpe writes that Home owed his appointment to Stuart\'s advocacy rather than to any great enthusiasm on the Prime Minister\'s part (Churchill referred to him as ""Home sweet Home"").[50] In addition to his ministerial position Home was appointed to membership of the Privy Council (PC),[50] an honour granted only selectively to ministers below cabinet rank.[51]', ""The following year the Cuban Missile Crisis threatened to turn the Cold War into a nuclear one. Soviet nuclear missiles were brought to Cuba, provocatively close to the US. The American president, John F Kennedy, insisted that they must be removed, and many thought that the world was on the brink of catastrophe with nuclear exchanges between the two super-powers.[79]  Despite a public image of unflappable calm, Macmillan was by nature nervous and highly strung.[29] During the missile crisis, Home, whose calm was genuine and innate, strengthened the Prime Minister's resolve, and encouraged him to back up Kennedy's defiance of Soviet threats of nuclear attack.[29]  The Lord Chancellor (Lord Dilhorne), the Attorney General (Sir John Hobson) and the Solicitor General, (Sir Peter Rawlinson) privately gave Home their opinion that the American blockade of Cuba was a breach of international law,[n 6] but he continued to advocate a policy of strong support for Kennedy.[82] When Khrushchev backed down and removed the Soviet missiles from Cuba, Home commented:"", ""There has been a good deal of speculation about Russia's motives. To me they are quite clear. Their motive was to test the will of the United States and to see how the President of the United States, in particular, would react against a threat of force. If the President had failed for one moment in a matter which affected the security of the United States, no ally of America would have had confidence in United States protection ever again.[83]"", 'It was assumed in the Times article, and by other commentators, that if Hailsham (or Home) was a candidate he would have to renounce his peerage.[87] This had been made possible for the first time by recent legislation.[n 7] The last British prime minister to sit in the House of Lords was the third Marquess of Salisbury in 1902. By 1923, having to choose between Baldwin and Lord Curzon, George V decided that ""the requirements of the present times"" obliged him to appoint a prime minister from the Commons. His private secretary recorded that the King ""believed he would not be fulfilling his trust were he now to make his selection of Prime Minister from the House of Lords"".[90] Similarly, after the resignation of Neville Chamberlain in 1940 there were two likely successors, Churchill and Halifax, but the latter ruled himself out for the premiership on the grounds that his membership of the House of Lords disqualified him.[91] In 1963, therefore, it was well established that the Prime Minister should be a member of the House of Commons.[2] On 10 October Hailsham announced his intention to renounce his viscountcy.[92]\nThe ""customary processes"" once again took place. The usual privacy of the consultations was made impossible because they took place during the party conference, and the potential successors made their bids very publicly. Butler had the advantage of giving the party leader\'s keynote address to the conference in Macmillan\'s absence, but was widely thought to have wasted the opportunity by delivering an uninspiring speech.[93] Hailsham put off many potential backers by his extrovert, and some thought vulgar, campaigning.[94] Maudling, like Butler, made a speech that failed to impress the conference. Senior Conservative figures such as Lord Woolton and Selwyn Lloyd urged Home to make himself available for consideration.[95]', 'The Parliamentary leader of the opposition Labour party, Harold Wilson, attacked the new prime minister as ""an elegant anachronism"". He asserted that nobody from Douglas-Home\'s background knew of the problems of ordinary families. In particular, Wilson demanded to know how ""a scion of an effete establishment"" could lead the technological revolution that Wilson held to be necessary: ""This is the counter-revolution\xa0... After half a century of democratic advance, of social revolution, the whole process has ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl!""[120] Douglas-Home dismissed this as populist anti-elitism, and observed, ""I suppose Mr Wilson, when you come to think of it, is the fourteenth Mr Wilson.""[29][121] He called Wilson ""this slick salesman of synthetic science"" and the Labour party ""the only relic of class consciousness in the country"".[122] The opposition retreated, with a statement in the press that ""The Labour Party is not interested in the fact that the new Prime Minister inherited a fourteenth Earldom\xa0– he cannot help his antecedents any more than the rest of us.""[123]', 'A plot to kidnap Douglas-Home in April 1964 was foiled by the Prime Minister himself. Two left-wing students from the University of Aberdeen followed him to the house of John and Priscilla Buchan, where he was staying. He was alone at the time and answered the door, where the students told him that they planned to kidnap him. He responded, ""I suppose you realise if you do, the Conservatives will win the election by 200 or 300."" He gave his intending abductors some beer, and they abandoned their plot.[n 12]', ""By temperament and background he was some distance removed from Heath's passionate commitment to a united Europe. All the more important was his steadfast support for British entry, which he based on a clear assessment of Britain's place in the modern world, and in particular her relationship with France and Germany on the one hand and the United States on the other\xa0... thus providing the right of the Conservative Party with much needed assurance.[29]""]"

An underachiever academically, he excelled at sports, and became chief cadet captain before graduating in 1918 with the King\'s Medal, awarded for ""gentlemanly bearing, character, good influence among his fellows and officer-like qualities"".[1][2] The following year he was posted to Britain as a midshipman, undergoing training with the Royal Navy and seeing service on HMS\xa0Ramillies and HMS\xa0Venturous.[3] He was promoted to sub-lieutenant on 15 April 1921. By January 1923 he was back in Australia, serving aboard the cruiser HMAS\xa0Adelaide. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 March.[4] In April 1924, Adelaide joined the Royal Navy\'s Special Service Squadron on its worldwide cruise, taking in New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Panama, and the West Indies, before docking in September at Portsmouth, England. There Dowling left the ship for his next appointment, training as a gunnery officer and serving in that capacity at HMS\xa0Excellent.[3][5]', ""Dowling was an early advocate for the establishment of an Australian submarine fleet; in 1963, after several false starts, the first of six Oberon-class submarines was ordered.[1][29]  As part of a general Western trend that viewed with alarm the increasing capability of the Soviet Navy's surface fleet, Dowling also worked to improve the offensive power of the Fleet Air Arm. In March 1956, he went so far as proposing purchase of nuclear weaponry for the RAN's De Havilland Sea Venoms. During much of Dowling's remaining time as CNS, faced with the obsolescence of HMAS Sydney and in accordance with its two-carrier policy, the Navy tried unsuccessfully to acquire a new and larger aircraft carrier to augment HMAS\xa0Melbourne.[30] Believing in the maintenance of traditionally close ties between the RAN and the Royal Navy, he worked to coordinate his policies as CNS with those of Britain's First Sea Lord, Earl Mountbatten.[1][3] Taking into account the provisions of the ANZUS treaty and the absence of suitable supplies from Britain, the RAN began to turn reluctantly towards the United States in terms of strategy and equipment,[3] as Dowling explained to Mountbatten:"", 'We now find ourselves at the crossroads because we very much doubt whether the United Kingdom can provide us with what we want in the future. We have no wish to become Americans but there is a strong belief in this country that the sensible course of action for Australians is to acquire war equipment from the United States now.

In 1934, there were 299 part-time officers in the AAMC; by 1939 there were 394, an increase of only 32 per cent. This included 320 medical practitioners, 37 dentists and 13 pharmacists.[59] Downes was acutely aware that a large Army would require mobilisation of the country's doctors, and pushed for all doctors to be prepared for either military service or direction by civil authorities. He presided over a major effort to stockpile drugs and medical equipment required for a mobilisation. With the help of the Department of Health and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, most of this was delivered by July 1939.[61]\nIn 1939, Downes began a tour of military and other medical centres in India, the Middle East, the United Kingdom, France, the United States and Canada.[62] While in London, he arranged for Doris and Valerie to be formally presented to the King and Queen at Buckingham Palace by Ethel Bruce, the wife of Stanley Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.[63] Downes foresaw a major war, fought in the islands to the north of Australia. Still in London, he took steps to obtain the services as consultants of two eminent Australian doctors: the surgeon Sir Thomas Dunhill and Neil Hamilton Fairley, an expert on tropical diseases.[64] The outbreak of the Second World War caused Downes to curtail the North American leg of his tour and return to Australia in October 1939.[62]"", 'Downes, in his role as DGMS, pressed for the construction of major military hospitals in the state capital cities. He argued that, after the war, they should be handed over to the Repatriation Department for the care of sick and disabled ex-service personnel. Despite strong opposition on the grounds of cost, Downes won his case in October 1940. The major military hospitals in the state capital cities, the Concord Repatriation General Hospital in Sydney, the Austin Hospital in Melbourne and Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane remain part of his legacy.[65]\nIn late 1940, medical units in the Middle East were experiencing ""precarious and at times acute"" shortages of medicals stores. Units were sent to the Middle East as fully equipped as was possible, with the expectation that the British Army would make up the difference, but British policy was that all possible sources had to be exploited before any demands could be made on the United Kingdom\'s sources. General Sir Thomas Blamey, the Commander in Chief of the AIF, recognised this as something that had to be negotiated between the two governments,[66] but medical officers in the Middle East blamed the Medical Services in Australia—and therefore Downes—for the situation. The Minister for the Army, Percy Spender decided to pay a visit to the Middle East to see the situation for himself but before he did so, he resolved that Downes should become Director of Medical Services, AIF (Middle East). On arrival in the Middle East with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, Spender found that Blamey had already appointed Major General Samuel Burston to that post. This came as a surprise to them as they had not realised that Blamey had the authority to make such an appointment; but on seeing the situation for himself, Spender confirmed Burston\'s appointment.[67]']"

Du Bois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta Compromise. Instead, Du Bois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth, a concept under the umbrella of racial uplift, and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.', ""In 1892, Du Bois received a fellowship from the John F.

He primarily played the power forward position and also played center throughout his career. He is a five-time NBA champion, a two-time NBA MVP, a three-time NBA Finals MVP, a 15-time NBA All-Star,[7] and the only player to be selected to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive Teams for 13 consecutive seasons.[8]', 'Duncan never swam competitively again, but his brother-in-law inspired him to turn to basketball.[13] Initially, Duncan had difficulties adapting to the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. St. Croix Country Day School athletic director Nancy Pomroy has said, ""[Duncan] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time.""[14] He overcame his awkwardness to become a standout for the St. Dunstan\'s Episcopal High School, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play attracted the attention of several universities.[15] Wake Forest University basketball coach Dave Odom, in particular, grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star Alonzo Mourning to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game.[11] Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket.[11] Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation.[16] But after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan\'s demeanor and discovered that he was not only a talented athlete but also a quick learner.[16] Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware, and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom\'s Wake Forest Demon Deacons.[11]', 'In the year before Duncan\'s arrival at Wake Forest University, the Demon Deacons had reached the Sweet 16, but then lost leading scorer Rodney Rogers, who entered the 1993 NBA draft.[11] In the 1993–94 NCAA season, Coach Dave Odom was considering redshirting Duncan, but was forced to play him after fellow freshman big man Makhtar N\'Diaye violated NCAA rules and eventually transferred to Michigan.[17] Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate Randolph Childress led the Deacons to a 20–11 win–loss record.[11] Duncan\'s style of play was simple yet effective, combining an array of low-post moves, mid-range bank shots, and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 Goodwill Games.[11] Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature.[16] Despite his heavy focus on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best said, ""Tim ... was one of my more intellectual students. ... Other than his height, I couldn\'t tell him from any other student at Wake Forest.""[16] Duncan also established his reputation as a stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as ""Mr. Spock"", the prototype of a logical, detached character from Star Trek.[16]', ""In the 1994–95 NCAA season, the sophomore was soon called one of the best prospects among those eligible for the NBA, along with peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace, and Jerry Stackhouse.[11] Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early; however, Duncan said that he had no intention of going pro before graduation, despite the NBA's plan to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. Though it meant passing up a large amount of money, Duncan was loath to deviate from his determination to stay in school.[11] In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against the Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels.[18] During that game, Duncan neutralized Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime.[11] In the NCAA tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16. Playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but Wake Forest still lost, 71–66. Duncan ended the season averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year, and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game.[11] He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in his two remaining years at Wake Forest.[19]"", ""During the 1995–96 NCAA season, Wake Forest lost Childress, who had graduated the previous season and entered the NBA. In Childress's absence, Duncan led the team to a 12–4 ACC record, and a 26–6 record overall.[11] The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again,[20] but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with the flu, and his team missed the Final Four. His season averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game led to another ACC Defensive Player of the Year award and his first ACC Player of the Year award.[19][21] Although the Wake Forest star was now rumored to be entering the 1996 NBA draft, he stayed in college.[11]"", ""In the 1996–97 NCAA season, new 7\xa0ft 1\xa0in (2.16\xa0m) Demon Deacon and future NBA player Loren Woods eased the pressure on Duncan close to the basket.

He earned first-team All-American honors for the second time and was a unanimous pick for both the Oscar Robertson Trophy and Naismith College Player of the Year.[11] Duncan was first in the 1996–97 NCAA Division I in rebounding, tenth in blocked shots (3.3 bpg), and 28th in scoring (20.8 ppg).[19] He was voted ACC Player of the Year again and, based on the votes of sportscasters and newswriters, won the 1997 John Wooden Award as the NCAA's best overall male player.[25]"", 'In college, Duncan co-authored a chapter in the social psychology book Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors with Mark Leary.[26][27] After earning his college degree in psychology,[28] Duncan entered the 1997 NBA draft.[29] In 2009, Duncan was inducted into the Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame.[30]', 'In the 1997 NBA draft, the San Antonio Spurs drafted Duncan with the first draft pick.[7] The Spurs were coming off an injury-riddled 1996–97 season; their best player, David Robinson—himself a number one draft pick in 1987—was sidelined for most of the year, and they finished with a 20–62 win–loss record.[31] In the 1997–98 season, Duncan and Robinson became known as the ""Twin Towers"". The duo earned a reputation for their exceptional defense close to the basket.[11] From the beginning, Duncan established himself as a quality player: In his second road game, he grabbed 22 rebounds against Chicago Bulls Hall-of-Fame power forward Dennis Rodman, a multiple rebounding champion and NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[32] Duncan was voted to the 1998 NBA All-Star Game by coaches. Later, when Duncan played against Houston Rockets Hall-of-Fame power forward Charles Barkley, Barkley was so impressed he said, ""I have seen the future and he wears number 21.""[33] In his rookie season, Duncan lived up to expectations of being the first draft pick, starting in all 82 regular season games, averaging 21.1 points, 11.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, and earning All-NBA First Team honors.[7] His defensive contributions ensured that he was chosen for the NBA All-Defensive Second Team and was also named NBA Rookie of the Year, having won the NBA Rookie of the Month award every single month that season.[15][34] Spurs coach Gregg Popovich lauded Duncan\'s mental toughness, stating his rookie\'s ""demeanor was singularly remarkable"", Duncan always ""put things into perspective"" and never got ""too upbeat or too depressed.""[35] Center Robinson was equally impressed with Duncan: ""He\'s the real thing. I\'m proud of his attitude and effort. He gives all the extra effort and work and wants to become a better player.""[36]', ""During his basketball career, Duncan received a number of individual and team honors, including being a two-time MVP (2002, 2003), five-time NBA champion (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014), and three-time NBA Finals MVP (1999, 2003, 2005). As a college player, he was honored by the House of Representatives,[138] named the ACC Male Athlete of the Year, won the John R. Wooden Award and Adolph Rupp Trophy, and was selected as the Naismith College Player of the Year in addition to player of the year honors from the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and Sporting News (all 1997).[19] In 2002, Duncan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[139] In his debut year in the NBA (1998), he was voted Rookie of the Year and elected into the All-Rookie Team. He has been named to 15 NBA All-Star teams (1997–98; 1999–2000 to 2010–11; 2012–13 and 2014–15), 15 All-NBA Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10, 2012–13, 2014–15; ten First Team nominations), and 15 All-Defensive Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10; 2012–13, 2014–15; eight First Team nominations).[7] With these impressive performances, Duncan is one of only four players to receive All-NBA First Team honors in each of his first eight seasons (1998–2005), along with Hall-of-Famers Bob Pettit (ten seasons), Larry Bird (nine seasons), and Oscar Robertson (nine seasons), and is the only player in NBA history to receive All-NBA and All-Defensive honors in his first 13 seasons (1997–98 to 2009–10).[140]""]"

Dunstan became Attorney-General after the 1965 election, and replaced the older Frank Walsh as premier in 1967. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the Liberal and Country League (LCL), Labor lost two seats at the 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander, convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment.

The latter half of 1967 saw the beginnings of a slight recovery, with unemployment dipping and industrial capacity steadying.

However, the six weeks of protesting had brought nationwide criticism of the unfairness of the electoral system and put more pressure on the LCL to relent to reforms; it has been seen as one of the most important political events of its time.[63]"", 'Dunstan wasted no time in organising his new ministry. He served as his own Treasurer, and took several other portfolios for himself.[4] Deputy Premier Des Corcoran took on most infrastructure portfolios: Marine and Harbours, and Public Works. Corcoran became the face of the Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes.[74] Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the Flinders Medical Centre and Modbury Hospital.[75] Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in a government that was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system.[76] Geoff Virgo, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS) plans.[77] Len King was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being a new member of parliament.[73] Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style radically different from his predecessors.[75][78]', 'Dunstan wasted no time in organising his new ministry.

His Government, on a mandate to dramatically increase funding in key areas, sought to appropriate further finances from the Federal Government. This brought Dunstan into conflict with Prime Minister John Gorton, and federal funding to SA was not increased. An appeal was made to the Federal Grants Commission, and Dunstan was awarded more than he had hoped for. In addition to the money received from the Grants Commission, funds were diverted from water-storage schemes in the Adelaide Hills over the advice of engineers, and cash reserves were withdrawn from the two government-owned banks. The monies were subsequently used to finance health, education and arts schemes.[79]"", ""On the death in office of Governor Sir James Harrison in 1971, Dunstan finally had the opportunity to put forward a nominee for governor of his own choosing to HM Queen Elizabeth II (and by extension the British Foreign Office[80] which still technically oversaw the appointment process of Australian state governors until the Australia Act 1986): Sir Mark Oliphant, a physicist who had worked on the Manhattan Project.[81][82][83] Dunstan had never been happy that governors were usually British ex-servicemen and it was a personal goal of his to see an active and notable South Australian take on the role; Sir Mark Oliphant was uneventfully sworn in.[84] Although the post is mostly ceremonial (with the exception of constitutional responsibilities), Oliphant brought energy to the role and he used his stature to decry damage to the environment caused by deforestation, excessive open-cut mining and pollution.[85] Oliphant's tenure was successful and held in high regard, although he did come into conflict with the premier at times as both men were outspoken and strong-willed.[82]"", ""Dunstan continued to try to  push through further legislation; he sought to expand on the Hall Government's electoral-boundaries reform,[121] to bring it closer to one vote one value. The legislation sought to establish 47 electoral districts containing roughly equal numbers of voters (with a 10% tolerance). Redistributions were to be presided over by an independent boundaries commission. The bill passed with the support of the breakaway LM in the upper house\xa0– former Premier Steele Hall and his former Attorney-General Robin Millhouse.[122][123]"", 'After Oliphant\'s term had expired, Dunstan appointed the first Indigenous Australian Governor,[2] Sir Douglas Nicholls, a former football player and clergyman. Following Nicholls\' resignation due to ill health in 1977, a second consecutive clergyman took the post, Methodist Keith Seaman.[123] However, this appointment was not successful; Seaman became involved in an unspecified scandal and made a statement admitting to a ""grave impropriety"", without elaborating further. He did not resign and kept a low profile from then on.[82] Dunstan also appointed Dame Roma Mitchell to become the nation\'s first female Supreme Court judge.[131]', 'Together with Mike Rann, his press secretary and speechwriter (and later Premier), who had worked with him in 1978 on a series of speeches on Aboriginal Land Rights, industrial democracy and women\'s rights, Dunstan made a uranium fact-finding trip to Europe to study safe methods of generating nuclear power and of nuclear waste disposal.[149] By the summer that followed Dunstan became extremely ill.[150] When Parliament resumed, he collapsed on the floor of the House and was forced to use a walking stick; his doctor advised him that he required six months of rest to recover. The Liberal Opposition seized on the state of affairs and charged that the Labor Party was ""as ailing as the man who led it"". In a stage-managed press conference on 15 February 1979, Dunstan announced his retirement as premier from his room in Calvary Hospital, clearly shaking and wearing a dressing gown.[151][152][153] The book, It\'s Grossly Improper, by two Adelaide journalists, Des Ryan and Mike McEwen, was published later that year.[154]', ""After Dunstan's resignation from Parliament, deputy Des Corcoran took his place as party leader and Premier. At the subsequent Norwood by-election, Dunstan's seat was retained by Labor. Corcoran soon called the 1979 election, which left the party with only 19 seats against the Liberals on 25 seats on an 8.4 percent two-party swing against Labor.[60] The Tonkin Liberal Government came to power and officially abandoned the Monarto project. Dunstan took a trip to Europe after being released from hospital, staying in Perugia for five months and pursuing Italian studies. He subsequently returned home and lived quietly in Adelaide for three years without finding work that appealed to him, such as that related to the shaping of public policy.[156]"", ""In 1993, Dunstan was diagnosed with an aggressive throat cancer and then an inoperable lung cancer, which led to his death on 6 February 1999. Dunstan was not a smoker but was long exposed to passive smoking.[175] A public memorial service was held on 9 February at the Adelaide Festival Centre as a tribute to Dunstan's love of the arts. In attendance were former Labor Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke, Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, Premier John Olsen, and State Opposition Leader Mike Rann. Thousands more gathered outside the centre in Elder Park along the banks of the River Torrens.[176] State flags were flown at half-mast and the memorial service was televised live.""]"

He commanded the 2/7th Field Regiment during the First and Second Battles of El Alamein in the Western Desert campaign in North Africa in 1942, leading to his appointment as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order. Upon return from the Middle East, he commanded the artillery of the 7th Division during the final stage of the Salamaua–Lae campaign and during the Markham, Ramu and Finisterre campaigns in New Guinea between August 1943 and April 1944. He commanded the artillery of the 9th Division in the Borneo campaign in 1945. Eastick was the military governor of the Raj of Sarawak after taking the Japanese surrender at Kuching, and the commander of the Headquarters Group of Central Command in South Australia from 1950 to 1953.', ""Due to rapid developments in the war and strategic uncertainty over the role of Australian forces in the Pacific, the 9th Division remained in Australia for over a year before seeing action once more. While the Australian I Corps (of which the 9th Division was part) had originally been intended to participate in the liberation of the Philippines, these plans were dropped, and the Corps was instead tasked with the liberation of Borneo between 1 May and 15 August 1945.[22] This was the division's final involvement in the war and its participation in the campaign was split into two primary operations: the Battle of Tarakan, a landing on Tarakan Island also known as Operation Oboe One; and Operation Oboe Six, which consisted of a landing at Brunei on the north Borneo coast, and a landing and subsequent battle on the island of Labuan.[23]"", 'The 9th Division was responsible for administering the Japanese surrender in British Borneo, including Sarawak, Brunei and Labuan Island, and the Natuna Islands. This territory was divided into five zones, one of which was the Raj of Sarawak south of the mouth of the Rajang River. Eastick was appointed commander of Kuching Force, which was responsible for the latter zone, Kuching being the capital of the Raj of Sarawak. Kuching Force totalled around 2,000 men from the 2/4th Pioneer Battalion, 2/12th Commando Squadron, engineers from the 2/7th Field Company, and assorted other units.[24] On 6 September, Eastick flew to Kuching in a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat and gave instructions to Japanese officers regarding the surrender before departing. Two days later, he sailed back to Kuching aboard the Bathurst-class corvette HMAS\xa0Kapunda, and at 14:35 on 11 September he took the surrender from Major General Hiyoe Yamamura aboard Kapunda. Kuching Force disembarked that afternoon. Eastick was responsible for: accepting the surrender of the Japanese in his zone and interning them; releasing and evacuating around 2,017 Allied prisoners of war (POWs) and internees, including 400 stretcher cases and 237 women and children; and establishing military control in the zone.[25] This included liberating and repatriating Allied POWs held in the large Batu Lintang camp.[1] By 14 September, 858 POWs and internees had been evacuated.[26] By the end of October, 6,124 Japanese troops and 1,770 Japanese civilians were interned in the Kuching Force zone.[27] Eastick was military governor of Sarawak until December, when a British Indian Army garrison arrived to relieve Kuching Force.[28] Eastick then administered command of the 9th Division until February 1946, and on 28 February he transferred to the Reserve of Officers with the honorary rank of brigadier.

He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt.[3] He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 7\xa0April, in recognition of his leadership of No.\xa03 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy.[16][17]"", 'Eaton was posted to Britain following the end of World War\xa0II, and attended RAF Staff College the next year.[5] In September 1947, he was appointed Officer Commanding No.\xa081 (Fighter) Wing in Japan, as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF).

By mid-1949, it had been reduced to No.\xa077 Squadron alone, and Headquarters BCOF had been disbanded; Eaton served as ""RAAF Component"" commander for the remainder of his tenure in Japan.[25] As well as surveillance patrols, training and inter-service exercises, the Australian airmen took part in ceremonial flypasts. On one such occasion, over Tokyo, Eaton led his formation of thirty Mustangs into cloud with a faulty artificial horizon in his plane, with the result that he and his comrades, who were following his lead, became badly disorientated and were fortunate to avoid collision; RAAF historian Alan Stephens considered this a not-atypical example of the casual attitude to flying safety exhibited at the time by the veteran pilots of World War\xa0II.[26]']"

Posted as a bomber pilot to No.\xa0206 Squadron, he was twice captured by German forces, and twice escaped. Eaton left the military in 1920 and worked in India until moving to Australia in 1923. Two years later he joined the RAAF, serving initially as an instructor at No.\xa01 Flying Training School. Between 1929 and 1931, he was chosen to lead three expeditions to search for lost aircraft in Central Australia, gaining national attention and earning the Air Force Cross for his ""zeal and devotion to duty"".[1]', 'In 1939, on the eve of World War II, Eaton became the inaugural commanding officer of No.\xa012 (General Purpose) Squadron at the newly established RAAF Station Darwin in Northern Australia.

In 1943, he took command of No.\xa079 Wing at Batchelor, Northern Territory, and was mentioned in despatches during operations in the South West Pacific. Retiring from the RAAF in December 1945, Eaton took up diplomatic posts in the Dutch East Indies, heading a United Nations commission as Consul-General during the Indonesian National Revolution. He returned to Australia in 1950, and served in Canberra for a further two years. Popularly known as ""Moth"" Eaton, he was a farmer in later life, and died in 1979 aged 83. He is commemorated by several memorials in the Northern Territory.', 'On 14\xa0May 1915, Eaton transferred to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), undergoing initial pilot training at Oxford. While he was landing his Maurice Farman Shorthorn at the end of his first solo flight, another student collided with him and was killed, but Eaton was uninjured.[3] He was commissioned in August and was awarded his wings in October. Ranked lieutenant, he served with No.\xa0110 Squadron, which operated Martinsyde G.100 ""Elephant"" fighters out of Sedgeford, defending London against Zeppelin airships.[2][5] He was transferred to the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1918, and posted the following month to France flying Airco DH.9 single-engined bombers with No.\xa0206 Squadron.[3] On 29\xa0June, he was shot down behind enemy lines and captured in the vicinity of Nieppe. Incarcerated in Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp, Germany, Eaton escaped but was recaptured and court-martialled, after which he was kept in solitary confinement. He later effected another escape and succeeded in rejoining his squadron in the final days of the war.[2][6]', 'Eaton retired from the RAAF on 31\xa0December 1945.[9] In recognition of his war service, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau with Swords by the Dutch government on 17\xa0January 1946.[37] The same month, he became Australian consul in Dili. He had seen an advertisement for the position and was the only applicant with experience of the area. While based there, he accompanied the provincial governor on visits to townships damaged in Allied raids during the war, taking care to be circumspect about the part played by his own forces from No.\xa079 Wing.[38] In July 1947, Dutch forces launched a ""police action"" against territory held by the fledgling Indonesian Republic, which had been declared shortly after the end of the war. Following a ceasefire, the United Nations set up a commission, chaired by Eaton as Consul-General, to monitor progress. Eaton and his fellow commissioners believed that the ceasefire was serving the Dutch as a cover for further penetration of republican enclaves. His requests to the Australian government for military observers led to deployment of the first peacekeeping force to the region; the Australians were soon followed by British and US observers, and enabled Eaton to display a more realistic impression of the situation to the outside world. The Dutch administration strongly opposed the presence of UN forces and accused Eaton of ""impropriety"", but the Australian government refused to recall him.[39] Following the transfer of sovereignty in December 1949, he became Australia\'s first secretary and chargé d\'affaires to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia.[38] In 1950, he returned to Australia to serve with the Department of External Affairs in Canberra.[2] After retiring from public service in 1951, he and his wife farmed at Metung, Victoria, and cultivated orchids.[38][40] They later moved to Frankston, where Eaton was involved in promotional work.[2]']"

Eckfeldt is given as the source for the tradition that the half dismes were struck at the request of President George Washington to be used as presents.[9] Eckfeldt operated his screw press to strike these roughly 1,500 pieces on July 13, 1792.[3] Since the first Philadelphia Mint was still under construction at the time, these coins were produced in the cellar of John Harper, saw maker, at Sixth and Cherry Streets in Philadelphia.[5][10]   In his annual message to Congress late that year, Washington noted the ongoing construction of a mint building and stated: ""There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dismes, the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.""[11]', ""Eckfeldt continued to work intermittently for the Philadelphia Mint; in 1793, he built a device for automatically feeding planchets into the die collar and ejecting the struck coins, and the mint's records reveal that he did piecework there in July 1795.[15] By October 1795 he was on the mint's payroll, as a die forger and turner, at a salary of $500 per year.[4] On January 1, 1796, Mint Director Elias Boudinot appointed him as assistant coiner, with the consent of President Washington.[1]  His duties in that capacity were broad.[4]"", 'In 1805, at Boudinot\'s request, Eckfeldt eliminated a security problem for the Mint by renting two houses adjacent to its operations, allowing it to shut an internal alley to public access.[16] The following year, new Mint Director Robert Patterson requested a pay increase of $200 for Eckfeldt, writing to President Thomas Jefferson that Eckfeldt had ""the management of the whole coining department"".[4] When the dies used proved too brittle and cracked easily, Eckfeldt came up with the idea of spraying water on the face of the die so the steel would temper evenly.[15]', 'On the death of the first chief coiner, Henry Voigt, in early 1814, Eckfeldt was appointed by President James Madison as successor.

To stage a European-wide crusade, it was essential to prevent conflict between the sovereigns on the Continent.[126] A major obstacle to this was represented by the conflict between the French Capetian House of Anjou ruling southern Italy and the Crown of Aragon in Spain.[126] In 1282, the citizens of Palermo rose up against Charles of Anjou and turned for help to Peter III of Aragon, in what has become known as the Sicilian Vespers.[127] In the war that followed, Charles of Anjou's son, Charles of Salerno, was taken prisoner by the Aragonese.[128] The French began planning an attack on Aragon, raising the prospect of a large-scale European war. To Edward, it was imperative that such a war be avoided, and in Paris in 1286 he brokered a truce between France and Aragon that helped secure Charles's release.[129] As far as the crusades were concerned, Edward's efforts proved ineffective.

Perhaps the best-known piece of legislation was the Statute of Labourers of 1351, which addressed the labour shortage problem caused by the Black Death. The statute fixed wages at their pre-plague level and checked peasant mobility by asserting that lords had the first claim on their men\'s services. In spite of concerted efforts to uphold the statute, it eventually failed due to competition among landowners for labour[114] The law has been described as an attempt ""to legislate against the law of supply and demand"", which made it doomed to fail.[115] Nevertheless, the labour shortage had created a community of interest between the smaller landowners of the House of Commons and the greater landowners of the House of Lords. The resulting measures angered the peasants, leading to the Peasants\' Revolt of 1381.[116]', 'Parliament as a representative institution was already well established by the time of Edward\xa0III, but the reign was nevertheless central to its development.[123] During this period, membership in the English baronage, formerly a somewhat indistinct group, became restricted to those who received a personal summons to Parliament.[124] This happened as Parliament gradually developed into a bicameral institution, composed of a House of Lords and a House of Commons.[125] Yet it was not in the Lords, but in the Commons that the greatest changes took place, with the expanding political role of the Commons. Informative is the Good Parliament, where the Commons for the first time—albeit with noble support—were responsible for precipitating a political crisis.[126] In the process, both the procedure of impeachment and the office of the Speaker were created.[127] Even though the political gains were of only temporary duration, this parliament represented a watershed in English political history.', ""Military failure abroad, and the associated fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent in England.[179] Finance was a particular grievance; although it was rarely raised as an issue before 1371, after that time complaints about the royal household's expenditure were frequent.[q] The problems came to a head in the Parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The Parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the King's closest advisors. Lord Chamberlain William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer, and Steward of the Household John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby, were dismissed from their positions.[179] Edward's mistress, Alice Perrers, who was seen to hold far too much power over the ageing king, was banished from court.[181][182] Yet the real adversary of the Commons, supported by powerful men such as Wykeham and Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, was John of Gaunt. Both the King and Edward of Woodstock were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt in virtual control of government.[183] Gaunt was forced to give in to the demands of Parliament, but at its next convocation in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.[184]"", ""Edward III was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, King Richard\xa0II, son of Edward of Woodstock, since Woodstock himself had died on 8\xa0June 1376.[186] In 1376, Edward had signed letters patent on the order of succession to the crown, citing in second position his third son John of Gaunt, but ignoring Philippa, daughter of his second son Lionel of Antwerp. Philippa's exclusion contrasted with a decision by Edward I in 1290, which had recognized the right of women to inherit the crown and to pass it on to their descendants.[187] The order of succession determined in 1376 led the House of Lancaster to the throne in 1399 (John of Gaunt was Duke of Lancaster), whereas the rule decided by Edward I would have favoured Philippa's descendants, among them the House of York, beginning with Richard of York, her great-grandson.[188] The large number of cousins that were created is sometimes argued to have laid the foundations for the Wars of the Roses in the fifteenth century.[189]"", 'Edward III, argues the scholar Michael A.R. Graves, left a ""dual legacy"". These were the large brood of children and grandchildren he left, and his claim to the French throne. In the first instance, his endowment of his sons as Dukes of Clarence, Lancaster and York allowed them to create their own dynasties which were both part of the royal family and the aristocracy, which, following Henry Bolingbroke\'s usurpation of Edward\'s grandson, Richard II, ""bedevilled"" the Lancastrian dynasty. [234] Secondly, while the resumption of Edward\'s claims and war in France was initially successful—contemporaries compared Henry V\'s decisive victory at Agincourt with Edward\'s at Crécy and Poitiers— when the tide turned against the English in France, the dynasty was also weakened.[234] Indeed, war in France was problematic for the House of York as well as Lancaster. Edward IV was probably consciously following in his namesake\'s footsteps when he invaded France in 1475, even if the subsequent Treaty of Picquigny was wholly unintended.[235] Edward IV\'s reign looked back on that of Edward III—with its martial and administrative progress—as something to model their own on, argues Morgan. Edward IV\'s own Household Books, summarise the approach as ""we take to bylde upon a more perfit new house"", and indeed many of their grants and warrants contain a final clause that whatever was under discussion should be as they were in Edward III\'s final year. Even the final destruction of the Plantagenets at Bosworth in 1485 failed to impinge on Edward III\'s posthumous image; he was also the most recent king Henry VII could lay claim of descent from.[236]']"

He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially France, for which he was popularly called ""Peacemaker"", but his relationship with his nephew, German Emperor Wilhelm\xa0II, was poor. The Edwardian era, which covered Edward\'s reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism.

He watched Charles Blondin traverse Niagara Falls by highwire, and stayed for three days with President James Buchanan at the White House. Buchanan accompanied the prince to Mount Vernon, to pay his respects at the tomb of George Washington. Vast crowds greeted Edward everywhere. He met Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. Prayers for the royal family were said in Trinity Church, New York, for the first time since 1776.[16] The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward's confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.[17]"", ""The couple established Marlborough House as their London residence and Sandringham House in Norfolk as their country retreat. They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles because most of Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of Schleswig and Holstein. When Alexandra's father, King Christian\xa0IX, inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the German Confederation took the opportunity to invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein. The Queen was in two minds as to whether it was a suitable match, given the political climate.[27] After the marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.[28]"", ""In 1869, Sir Charles Mordaunt, a British Member of Parliament, threatened to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, he did not do so but Edward was called as a witness in the case in early 1870.

Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.[12][36]"", 'Edward was regarded worldwide as an arbiter of men\'s fashions.[46][47] He made wearing tweed, Homburg hats and Norfolk jackets fashionable, and popularised the wearing of black ties with dinner jackets, instead of white tie and tails.[48] He pioneered the pressing of trouser legs from side to side in preference to the now normal front and back creases,[49] and was thought to have introduced the stand-up turn-down shirt collar, created for him by Charvet.[50] A stickler for proper dress, he is said to have admonished Lord Salisbury for wearing the trousers of an Elder Brother of Trinity House with a Privy Councillor\'s coat. Deep in an international crisis, Salisbury informed Edward that it had been a dark morning, and that ""my mind must have been occupied by some subject of less importance.""[51] The tradition of men not buttoning the bottom button of waistcoats is said to be linked to Edward, who supposedly left his undone because of his large girth.[12][52] His waist measured 48\xa0inches (122\xa0cm) shortly before his coronation.[53] He introduced the practice of eating roast beef and potatoes with horseradish sauce and Yorkshire pudding on Sundays, a meal that remains a staple British favourite for Sunday lunch.[54] He was a lifelong heavy smoker, but not a heavy drinker, though he did drink champagne and, occasionally, port.[55]', ""Edward donated his parents' house, Osborne on the Isle of Wight, to the state and continued to live at Sandringham.[69] He could afford to be magnanimous; his private secretary, Sir Francis Knollys, claimed that he was the first heir to succeed to the throne in credit.[70] Edward's finances had been ably managed by Sir Dighton Probyn, Comptroller of the Household, and had benefited from advice from Edward's financier friends, some of whom were Jewish, such as Ernest Cassel, Maurice de Hirsch and the Rothschild family.[71] At a time of widespread antisemitism, Edward attracted criticism for openly socialising with Jews.[72][73]"", ""While Prince of Wales, Edward had to be dissuaded from breaking with constitutional precedent by openly voting for W. E. Gladstone's Representation of the People Bill (1884) in the House of Lords.[12][90] On other matters, he was more conservative; for example, he did not favour giving votes to women,[12][91] although he did suggest that the social reformer Octavia Hill serve on the Commission for Working Class Housing.[92] He was also opposed to Irish Home Rule, instead preferring a form of dual monarchy.[12]"", 'In the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the Conservative majority in the House of Lords refused to pass the ""People\'s Budget"" proposed by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Asquith. The crisis eventually led—after Edward\'s death—to the removal of the Lords\' right to veto legislation.\nThe King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemical speech by David Lloyd George at Limehouse.[105] Cabinet minister Winston Churchill publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King\'s adviser Lord Knollys and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare—although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the First Home Rule Bill in 1886—that he introduced his son to Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane as ""the last King of England"".[106] After the King\'s horse Minoru won the Derby on 26 July 1909, he returned to the racetrack the following day and laughed when a man shouted: ""Now, King.

The new king showed impatience with court protocol, and caused consternation among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, a constitutional crisis was caused by his proposal to marry Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as titular head of the Church of England, which, at the time, disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew the Baldwin government would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would have ruined his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch. When it became apparent he could not marry Simpson and remain on the throne, he abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George VI. With a reign of 326 days, Edward was one of the shortest-reigning British monarchs to date."", ""By 1917, Edward liked to spend time partying in Paris while he was on leave from his regiment on the Western Front. He was introduced to Parisian courtesan Marguerite Alibert, with whom he became infatuated. He wrote her candid letters, which she kept. After about a year, Edward broke off the affair. In 1923, Alibert was acquitted in a spectacular murder trial after she shot her husband in the Savoy Hotel. Desperate efforts were made by the Royal Household to ensure that Edward's name was not mentioned in connection with the trial or Alibert.[42]"", 'George V favoured his second son Albert (""Bertie"") and Albert\'s daughter Elizabeth (""Lilibet""), later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II respectively. He told a courtier, ""I pray to God that my eldest son will never marry and have children, and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.""[45] In 1929, Time magazine reported that Edward teased Albert\'s wife, also named Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother), by calling her ""Queen Elizabeth"". The magazine asked if ""she did not sometimes wonder how much truth there is in the story that he once said he would renounce his rights upon the death of George V – which would make her nickname come true"".[46]', 'On 12 December 1936, at the accession meeting of the British Privy Council, George VI announced his intention to make his brother the ""Duke of Windsor"" with the style of Royal Highness.[79] He wanted this to be the first act of his reign, although the formal documents were not signed until 8 March the following year. During the interim, Edward was known as the Duke of Windsor. George VI\'s decision to create Edward a royal duke ensured that he could neither stand for election to the British House of Commons nor speak on political subjects in the House of Lords.[80]', ""The denial of the style Royal Highness to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, as did the financial settlement. The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess on the Civil List, and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI. Edward compromised his position with his brother by concealing the extent of his financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall paid to him as Prince of Wales and ordinarily at the disposal of an incoming king. George also paid Edward for Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession.[85] Edward received approximately £300,000 (equivalent to between £21\xa0million and £140\xa0million in 2021[86]) for both residences which was paid to him in yearly instalments. In the early days of George VI's reign Edward telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that Wallis be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.[87]"", 'In July 1940, Edward was appointed governor of the Bahamas. The Duke and Duchess left Lisbon on 1 August aboard the American Export Lines steamship Excalibur, which was specially diverted from its usual direct course to New York City so that they could be dropped off at Bermuda on the 9th.[107] They left Bermuda for Nassau on the Canadian National Steamship Company vessel Lady Somers on 15 August, arriving two days later.[108] Edward did not enjoy being governor and privately referred to the islands as ""a third-class British colony"".[109] The British Foreign Office strenuously objected when Edward and Wallis planned to cruise aboard a yacht belonging to Swedish magnate Axel Wenner-Gren, whom British and American intelligence wrongly believed to be a close friend of Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring.[110] Edward was praised for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands. He was ""considerably more enlightened in his attitudes than the majority of Bahamian whites, or either of his predecessors"", and had an ""excellent relationship"" with Black individuals such as jazz musician Bert Cambridge (who was eventually elected to the Bahamian House of Assembly, to Edward\'s delight) and valet Sydney Johnson, who Edward retained for thirty years and was said to have ""loved as a son"".[111] Edward maintained a long-standing dispute with Étienne Dupuch, the editor of the Nassau Daily Tribune, writing privately at one point that Dupuch was ""more than half Negro, and due to the peculiar mentality of this Race, they seem unable to rise to prominence without losing their equilibrium"".[112] But even Dupuch praised Edward for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau in 1942, though Edward blamed the trouble on ""mischief makers – communists"" and ""men of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft"".[113] He resigned from the post on 16 March 1945.[13]', 'Many historians have suggested that Adolf Hitler was prepared to reinstate Edward as king in the hope of establishing a fascist puppet government in Britain after Operation Sea Lion.[114] It is widely believed that the Duke and Duchess sympathised with fascism before and during the Second World War, and were moved to the Bahamas to minimise their opportunities to act on those feelings. In 1940 he said: ""In the past 10 years Germany has totally reorganised the order of its society\xa0... Countries which were unwilling to accept such a reorganisation of society and its concomitant sacrifices should direct their policies accordingly.""[115] During the occupation of France, the Duke asked the German Wehrmacht forces to place guards at his Paris and Riviera homes; they did so.[116] In December 1940, Edward gave Fulton Oursler of Liberty magazine an interview at Government House in Nassau. Oursler conveyed its content to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a private meeting at the White House on 23 December 1940.[117] The interview was published on 22 March 1941 and in it Edward was reported to have said that ""Hitler was the right and logical leader of the German people"" and that the time was coming for President Roosevelt to mediate a peace settlement.

The monastery was next to Winchester Cathedral, which became known as the Old Minster while Edward's foundation was called the New Minster. It was much larger than the Old Minster, and was probably intended as a royal mausoleum.[47] It acquired relics of the Breton Saint Judoc, which probably arrived in England from Ponthieu in 901, and the body of one of Alfred's closest advisers, Grimbald, who died in the same year and who was soon venerated as a saint. Edward's mother died in 902, and he buried her and Alfred there, moving his father's body from the Old Minster. Burials in the early 920s included Edward himself, his brother Æthelweard, and his son Ælfweard.

Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the Archbishopric of Canterbury.[f][g] This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England rather than the more contentious title of Supreme Head, which many thought unacceptable for a woman to bear. The new Act of Supremacy became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were forced to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the heresy laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters by Mary. At the same time, a new Act of Uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of the 1559 Book of Common Prayer (an adapted version of the 1552 prayer book) compulsory, though the penalties for recusancy, or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.[58]', 'Having previously promised to marry, she told an unruly House:', 'During the last years of her reign, Elizabeth came to rely on the granting of monopolies as a cost-free system of patronage, rather than asking Parliament for more subsidies in a time of war.[r] The practice soon led to price-fixing, the enrichment of courtiers at the public\'s expense, and widespread resentment.[185] This culminated in agitation in the House of Commons during the parliament of 1601.[186] In her famous ""Golden Speech"" of 30 November 1601 at Whitehall Palace to a deputation of 140 members, Elizabeth professed ignorance of the abuses, and won the members over with promises and her usual appeal to the emotions:[187]']"

Elizabeth issued a declaration on 9\xa0April 1952 that the royal house would continue to be Windsor. Philip complained, ""I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.""[65] In 1960, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth\'s male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.[66][67]', ""A year later, at the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the Australian prime minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.[109] As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to Elizabeth to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, saying she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general.[110] The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.[109]"", 'In October 1997, Elizabeth and Philip made a state visit to India, which included a controversial visit to the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to pay her respects. Protesters chanted ""Killer Queen, go back"",[168] and there were demands for her to apologise for the action of British troops 78 years earlier.[169] At the memorial in the park, she and Philip laid a wreath and stood for a 30‑second moment of silence.[169] As a result, much of the fury among the public softened, and the protests were called off.[168] That November, the royal couple held a reception at Banqueting House to mark their golden wedding anniversary.[170] Elizabeth made a speech and praised Philip for his role as consort, referring to him as ""my strength and stay"".[170]', 'In 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee, the 50th anniversary of her accession. Her sister and mother died in February and March, respectively, and the media speculated on whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure.[178] The death of her sister shook Elizabeth; her funeral was one of the rare occasions where Elizabeth openly cried.[179] Elizabeth again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, beginning in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet ""memorable"" after a power cut plunged King\'s House, the official residence of the governor-general, into darkness.[180] As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion.

When his elder brother William IV, who ruled both kingdoms, died in 1837, his niece Victoria inherited the British throne under British succession law, while Ernest succeeded in Hanover under Salic law, which barred women from the succession, thus ending the personal union between Britain and Hanover that had begun in 1714.', ""Ernest was an active member of the House of Lords, where he maintained an extremely conservative record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet, had fathered a son by his sister Sophia, and intended to take the British throne by murdering Victoria. Following the death of William IV, Ernest became Hanover's first resident ruler since George I. He had a generally successful fourteen-year reign but excited controversy near its start when he voided the liberal constitution granted before his reign and dismissed the Göttingen Seven, including the Brothers Grimm, from their professorial positions for protesting against this decision. In 1848, the King put down an attempted revolution. Hanover joined the German customs union in 1850 despite Ernest's reluctance.

According to the historian John Van der Kiste, this was done to limit the influence Ernest's eldest brother George, Prince of Wales, who was leading an extravagant lifestyle, would have over his younger brothers.[4] At the age of fifteen, Prince Ernest and his two younger brothers were sent to the University of Göttingen, located in his father's domain of Hanover.[3] Ernest proved a keen student and after being tutored privately for a year, while learning German, he attended lectures at the university. Though King George ordered that the princes' household be run along military lines and that they follow the university's rules, the merchants of the Electorate proved willing to extend credit to the princes and all three fell into debt.[5]"", 'On 23 April 1799, George III created Prince Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh,[17] and Ernest was granted an allowance of £12,000 a year,[18] equivalent to £1.49\xa0million in 2023.[19] Though he was made a lieutenant-general, of both British and Hanoverian forces,[20] he remained in England and, with a seat in the House of Lords, entered politics. Ernest had extreme Tory views and soon became a leader of the right wing of the party.[21] King George had feared that Ernest, like some of his elder brothers, would display Whig tendencies. Reassured on that point, in 1801, the King had Ernest conduct the negotiations which led to the formation of the Addington government.[22] In February 1802, King George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when a vacancy arose. A vacancy promptly occurred and the Duke became the colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802. Although the post could have been a sinecure, Ernest involved himself in the affairs of the regiment and led it on manoeuvres.[23]', 'The Acts of Union 1800 had given Ireland representation in Parliament, but existing law prevented Irish Catholics from serving there because of their religion.

The Duke of Cumberland was a strong opponent of giving political rights to Catholics, believing that emancipation would be a violation of the King\'s Coronation Oath to uphold Anglicanism and spoke out in the House of Lords against emancipation.[25] Protestant Irish organisations supported the Duke; he was elected Chancellor of the University of Dublin in 1805[26] and Grand Master of the Orange Lodges two years later.[27]', 'In early 1813, Ernest was involved in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown to be one of three trustees who were able to dictate who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to interfere in an election to the House of Commons, there was considerable controversy and the government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France.[38] Though he saw no action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies.[39] Following this, Ernest received ultimate promotion, to Field Marshal, on 26 November 1813.[1]', ""In 1826, Parliament finally voted to increase Ernest's allowance. The Liverpool government argued that the Duke needed an increased allowance to pay for Prince George's education; even so, it was opposed by many Whigs.[55] The bill, which passed the House of Commons 120–97, required George to live in England if Ernest was to receive the money.[56]"", ""In 1828, Ernest was staying with the King at Windsor Castle when severe disturbances broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the Irish.[57] In January 1829, the Wellington government announced that it would introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London and was one of the leading opponents to the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing George IV against the bill.[58] Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have had considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have had little support in the Commons and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.[59]"", 'The Duke\'s influence at court was ended by the death of George IV in June 1830 and the succession of the Duke of Clarence as William IV. Wellington wrote that ""the effect of the King\'s death will\xa0... be to put an end to the Duke of Cumberland\'s political character and power in this country entirely"".[68] King William had no legitimate children (two daughters having died in infancy)[54] and Ernest was now heir presumptive in Hanover, since the British heir presumptive, Princess Victoria, as a female could not inherit there. William realised that, so long as the Duke maintained a power base at Windsor, he could wield unwanted influence. The Duke was Gold Stick as head of the Household Cavalry; William made the Duke\'s post responsible to the Commander in Chief rather than to the King, and an insulted Ernest, outraged at the thought of having to report to an officer junior to himself, resigned.[68]', 'King William again emerged triumphant when the new queen, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, wished to quarter her horses in the stables customarily used by the consort, but which were then occupied by Ernest\'s horses. Ernest initially refused the King\'s order to remove the horses, but gave in when told that William\'s grooms would remove them if Ernest did not move them voluntarily.[68] However, Ernest and William remained friendly throughout the latter\'s seven-year reign.[69] Ernest\'s house at Kew was too small for his family; the King gave the Duke and Duchess lifetime residence in a nearby, larger house by the entrance to Kew Gardens.[70] Ernest, who was against the extension of civil and religious liberties,[18] opposed the Reform Act 1832 and was one of the ""diehard"" peers who voted against the bill on its final reading in which most Tories abstained under threat of seeing the House of Lords flooded with Whig peers.[71] His unpopularity was deepened by the suggestion that he favoured the creation of Orange lodges in the army.[18]', 'The Duke spent William IV\'s reign in the House of Lords, where he was assiduous in his attendance. Newspaper editor James Grant wrote that ""He is literally—the door-keeper of course excepted—the first man in the House and the last out of it. And this not merely generally, but every night.""[73] Grant, in his observations of the leading members of the House of Lords, indicated that the Duke was not noted for his oratory (he delivered no speech longer than five minutes) and had a voice that was difficult to understand, though ""his manner is most mild and conciliatory"".[73] Grant denigrated the Duke\'s intellect and influence, but stated that the Duke had indirect influence over several members, and that ""he is by no means so bad a tactician as his opponents suppose"".[74]', 'Controversy arose in 1836 over the Orange Lodges. The lodges (which took anti-Catholic views) were said to be ready to rise and try to put the Duke of Cumberland on the throne on the death of King William. According to Joseph Hume, speaking in the House of Commons, Victoria was to be passed over on the grounds of her age, sex, and incapacity.[75] The Commons passed a resolution calling for the dissolution of the lodges. When the matter reached the Lords, the Duke defended himself, saying of Princess Victoria, ""I would shed the last drop of my blood for my niece.""[76] The Duke indicated that the Orange Lodge members were loyal and were willing to dissolve the lodges in Great Britain. According to Bird, this incident was the source of the widespread rumours that Ernest intended to murder Victoria and take the British throne for himself.[77]', 'On 20 June 1837, William IV died; Victoria succeeded him as Queen of the United Kingdom, while Ernest Augustus became King of Hanover. On 28 June 1837, Ernest entered his new domain, passing under a triumphal arch.[78] For the first time in over a century, Hanover would have a ruler living there.[79] Many Hanoverians were of a liberal perspective and would have preferred the popular viceroy, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, to become king, but the Dukes of Sussex and Cambridge refused to lend themselves to any movement by which they would become king rather than their elder brother. According to Roger Fulford in his study of George III\'s younger sons, Royal Dukes, ""In 1837, King Ernest was the only male descendant of George III who was willing and able to continue the connection with Hanover.""[d]', 'In carrying the King\'s patent into effect, the Cabinet required all officeholders (including professors at Göttingen University) to renew their oaths of allegiance to the King. Seven professors (including the two Brothers Grimm) refused to take the oaths and agitated for others to protest against the King\'s decree.  Since they did not take the oaths, the seven lost their positions and the King expelled the three most responsible (including Jacob Grimm) from Hanover.[81] Only one of the seven, orientalist Heinrich Ewald, was a citizen of Hanover, and he was not expelled.[83] In the final years of the King\'s reign, the three were invited to return.[84] Ernest wrote of the incident to his brother-in-law, Frederick William III of Prussia, ""If each of these seven gentlemen had addressed a letter to me expressing his opinion, I would have had no cause to take exception to their conduct. But to call a meeting and publish their opinions even before the government had received their protest—that is what they have done and that I cannot allow.""[85] Ernest received a deputation of Göttingen citizens who, fearing student unrest, applauded the dismissals. However, he was widely criticised in Europe, especially in Britain.[86] In the British House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen Victoria died, making Ernest the British king, Parliament should declare that King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British throne by his actions.[87]', 'Every week, the King travelled with his secretary to different parts of his kingdom, and anyone could lay a petition before him—although Ernest had petitions screened by the secretary so he would not have to deal with frivolous complaints.[91] Ernest opened high ministerial positions to those of any class, securing the services of several ministers who would not have been eligible without this reform.[92] Though the King had, while Duke of Cumberland, fought against Catholic emancipation in Britain and Ireland, he made no objection to Catholics in government service in Hanover and even visited their churches.  Ernest explained this by stating that there were no historical reasons to restrict Catholics in Hanover, as there had been in the United Kingdom.[93] He continued to oppose admission of Jews into the British Parliament, but gave Jews in Hanover equal rights.[94]', 'Ernest Augustus is supposed to have asked the advice of the Duke of Wellington as to what course he should take after Victoria\'s accession, with Wellington supposedly saying ""Go before you are pelted out.""[100] However, Bird dismisses this story as unlikely, given Wellington\'s customary respect to royalty and the fact that Ernest had little choice in what to do—he had to go to his kingdom as quickly as possible.[101] One decision the new king did have to make was whether, in his capacity as Duke of Cumberland, to swear allegiance to Victoria in the House of Lords. Shortly after William\'s death, Ernest heard from Lord Lyndhurst that Lord Cottenham, the Lord Chancellor, had stated that he would refuse to administer the Oath of Allegiance to the King, as a foreign sovereign. The King hurriedly appeared in the House of Lords, before his departure for Hanover, and subscribed to the Oath before the Chief Clerk as a matter of routine.[102] Ernest was heir presumptive to Queen Victoria until the birth of her daughter Victoria, Princess Royal, in November 1840.  The Lord Privy Seal, Lord Clarendon, wrote, ""What the country cares about is to have a life more, whether male or female, between the succession and the King of Hanover.""[103]', 'Ernest Augustus is supposed to have asked the advice of the Duke of Wellington as to what course he should take after Victoria\'s accession, with Wellington supposedly saying ""Go before you are pelted out.""[100] However, Bird dismisses this story as unlikely, given Wellington\'s customary respect to royalty and the fact that Ernest had little choice in what to do—he had to go to his kingdom as quickly as possible.[101] One decision the new king did have to make was whether, in his capacity as Duke of Cumberland, to swear allegiance to Victoria in the House of Lords.

The Lord Privy Seal, Lord Clarendon, wrote, ""What the country cares about is to have a life more, whether male or female, between the succession and the King of Hanover.""[103]', 'Matters came to a head when Ernest returned for what would prove to be his only visit to England as King of Hanover, in 1843. He was welcomed warmly, everywhere but at the Palace.[106] At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The prince, 48 years Ernest\'s junior, settled things with what Albert described as a ""strong push"" and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen\'s, so close to his wife\'s as to leave no space for the King\'s signature.[107] The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the prince for a stroll in the park. When Albert demurred on the grounds that they might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, ""When I lived here I was quite as unpopular as you are and they never bothered me.""[108] Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, ""Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs."" This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert.[109] During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, ""No, I shall not, unless the Devil prompts me!""[110] The Queen also recorded that though the King greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak.[110] The King made a point of welcoming British visitors to Hanover and when one Englishwoman told him that she had been lost in the city, the King denied that this was possible, as ""the whole country is no larger than a fourpenny bit.""[111]', 'The King died on 18 November 1851 after an illness of about a month. He was mourned greatly in Hanover; less so in the United Kingdom, where The Times omitted the customary black border to its front page and claimed ""the good that can be said of the Royal dead is little or none.""[116] Both he and Queen Frederica rest in a mausoleum in the Berggarten of Herrenhausen Gardens.[117]']"

After spending a short time as a bank clerk, Evans duly enlisted in the RAAF on 5\xa0June 1943.[1][5] He received instruction under the Empire Air Training Scheme, firstly at No.\xa02 Initial Training School in Bradfield Park, Sydney, then at No.\xa05 Elementary Flying Training School in Narromine, New South Wales, and finally at No.\xa08 Service Flying Training School in Bundaberg, Queensland.[6][7] After graduating as a sergeant pilot, he was posted in October 1944 to the flying staff of No.\xa01 Air Observer School at Evans Head, New South Wales.[8][9] Promoted to flight sergeant, Evans was in the middle of a Bristol Beaufort light bomber conversion course at No.\xa01 Operational Training Unit in East Sale, Victoria, when the war ended on 14\xa0August 1945. His Air Force career should have finished then and there, as he was slated for demobilisation along with thousands of other wartime enlistees. Evans was determined to remain and travelled to RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne to take his case to the officer responsible for discharges. He found a sympathetic ear and within days was transferred to No.\xa038 Squadron, with which he flew C-47 Dakota transports on a regular courier service to Japan between October 1945 and May 1948.[9][10]', 'Returning to Australia in November 1949, Evans was posted to Central Flying School (CFS) at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria, where he qualified as a flying instructor.[9][18] He served in this capacity for the next four years, including an exchange posting with the Royal New Zealand Air Force from May 1951 to July 1953.[8][9] As he was preparing to depart New Zealand, he received word that his next posting would be to the Korean War as a pilot with No.\xa077 Squadron; the armistice prevented this and he returned to No.\xa038 Squadron as an instructor.[19] In 1954 he was assigned to transporting VIPs, serving with the Governor-General\'s Flight (later No.\xa034 (Special Transport) Squadron) until 1956.[8][20] As well as Governor-General Sir William Slim and Lady Slim, his passengers included Prime Minister Robert Menzies and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[21] Promoted to squadron leader, Evans\'s service with the VIP flight earned him the Air Force Cross in the Queen\'s Birthday Honours promulgated in the London Gazette on 13\xa0June 1957.[9][22] The same year, he attended RAAF Staff College at Point Cook, Victoria. He became personal staff officer to the Minister for Air in 1958, a position he found valuable for the insight he gained into Australia\'s political culture.[8][23] In November 1959, he took a refresher course at CFS, qualifying on De Havilland Vampire and English Electric Canberra jets. He underwent further training on Canberra bombers with No.\xa01 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, graduating in May 1960.[24] From then until 1962 he served as a flight commander in No.\xa02 Squadron, operating Canberras out of RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia. He subsequently attended the RAF College of Air Warfare.[2][8] In January 1963, Evans was transferred to Air Staff Division, Canberra, where he helped formulate operational requirements for a new RAAF bomber.[25] His final specification included a payload of 14,000\xa0lb (6,400\xa0kg), speed of Mach\xa02, and range of 1,100\xa0nmi (2,000\xa0km). This requirement was met by the General Dynamics F-111C, 24 of which were ordered by the Australian government in October 1963.[26] As an interim measure until delivery of the F-111, the US government offered 24 Boeing B-47 Stratojets to the RAAF. Though the offer was never seriously considered, a B-47 was test flown from Amberley to Darwin in November 1963 by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Val Hancock, with Evans as passenger. Evans had been assigned to fly the plane but was replaced at the last moment by Hancock; the take-off almost ended in disaster after Hancock unknowingly switched off the engines\' water injection—needed to ensure sufficient thrust in hot conditions—that Evans had switched on before vacating the pilot\'s seat.[27] In January 1965, Evans was posted to Washington, D.C., as assistant air attaché, having ""had quite enough of writing Air Staff Requirements"".[9][28]', 'In 1980, Evans was appointed Chief of Joint Operations and Plans for the Australian Defence Force (ADF). He was promoted to air marshal and became Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) on 21\xa0April 1982, succeeding Air Marshal Sir Neville McNamara.[8][44] As CAS, Evans took steps to enhance discipline, bearing and morale in the Air Force, demanding high personal standards.[45][46] He sponsored the development of an Australian air power doctrine, eventually published as the Air Power Manual under one of his successors, Air Marshal Ray Funnell, in 1990.[47] Evans also commissioned a marching tune especially for the RAAF, later to be called ""Eagles of Australia"", to replace the Royal Air Force march that had been in use previously.[48] As early as 1969, he had advocated permanently basing a squadron of fighter aircraft at RAAF Tindal in the Northern Territory. Tindal was one of a series of forward air bases initiated by Air Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger when he was CAS in 1959, but a defence committee decision prior to Evans becoming CAS had determined to locate the RAAF\'s northernmost fighter squadron at Darwin. His chance remark in mid-1982 to the new Minister of Defence, Ian Sinclair, regarding the suitability of Tindal over Darwin led to the former base being chosen as the home of No.\xa075 (Fighter) Squadron. Alan Stephens described the permanent manning of Tindal as having ""formalised the shift to the strategy of defence-in-depth—of defending Australia by controlling its air-sea gap"".[49][50] Late in 1983, Evans selected the site for the last of the Air Force\'s northerly ""bare bases"", RAAF Scherger, near Weipa on Cape York Peninsula.[51] For his service as CAS, he was raised to a Companion of the Order of Australia on 11\xa0June 1984.[52] On 2\xa0May 1985, he became the first serving member of the ADF to be invited to speak at the National Press Club in Canberra. During his speech he reiterated the need for Australia to acquire an airborne early warning capability to enhance the effectiveness of the soon-to-be-delivered F/A-18 Hornet multirole fighter, declaring that ""Jindalee is not sufficient"".[53] Later that month two Hornets, whose acquisition Evans had supported while CAFOPS, were handed over to No.\xa02 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, following a record non-stop flight from Naval Air Station Lemoore in California.[54][55] Evans had pushed for the long-distance flight, employing a McDonnell Douglas KC-10 tanker to refuel the Hornets in flight, to demonstrate the RAAF\'s capability and the benefit of tanker aircraft. Six Mirage fighters from No.\xa077 Squadron intercepted the Hornets and the KC-10 and escorted them to their landing at Williamtown, an action the CAS considered ""icing on the cake—a touch of class"".[56]', 'In 1990, Evans published his critique of Australian defence policies, A Fatal Rivalry: Australia\'s Defence at Risk; he followed this in 2000 with War: A Matter of Principles, featuring contributions from senior soldiers and military analysts.[45][63] Also in 1990, Evans joined the Board of British Aerospace Australia as a non-executive director, and was later appointed senior defence advisor to BAE Systems Australia, retiring in 2009.[15] From 1997 until 2003, he was chairman of the National Capital Authority, and from 1999 until 2003 was national president of the Royal United Services Institute Australia. Evans was patron of numerous organisations including the Airfield Defence Guards Association, the Royal Australian Air Force Association (ACT Division), The Celtic Club Australia, and the Royal Australian Air Force Staff College Association.[2] He was one of three former members of Australia\'s Berlin Airlift squadron ( the other members were retired Group Captain Ray Barber & Wing Commander  David Hahn ) to be specially honoured by the City of Berlin on the 50th anniversary of the Berlin Blockade in 1998.[64] In January 2001 he was awarded the Centenary Medal for ""service to Australian society through Australian Defence Force and to the Canberra community"".[65] He was chairman of the 60th Anniversary Victory in the Pacific Steering Committee in 2005.[2] His autobiography, Down to Earth, was launched on 19\xa0July 2011 by former Prime Minister John Howard at Old Parliament House, Canberra.[66]']"

As a result, the Executive Branch Ethics Commission charged Farmer with 42 ethics violations – the most against an individual in state history. Attorney General Jack Conway also charged Farmer with violating state campaign finance laws, and a federal grand jury followed with five indictments for abuses of power. Farmer initially contested the charges, but later agreed to a plea bargain. On January 14, 2014, Farmer was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $120,500 in restitution and $65,000 in fines. He served almost 20 months in a satellite camp of the United States Penitentiary, Hazelton near Bruceton Mills, West Virginia, before transitioning to a halfway house in Lexington, Kentucky, on December 18, 2015. He was released from the halfway house on January 21, 2016 and is currently residing in Clay County."", ""By the time Farmer arrived at Kentucky, the roster had been decimated.[57] Standout shooting guard Rex Chapman entered the 1988 NBA draft, ending his collegiate eligibility.[57] Sophomore Eric Manuel was held out of basketball activities pending the outcome of an investigation into his ACT scores.[57] Signees Shawn Kemp and Sean Woods failed to qualify academically, and Chris Mills was under investigation by the NCAA for cash allegedly sent to his father by assistant coach Dwane Casey in violation of the Association's amateurism rules.[57] A viral illness forced Farmer to miss about a third of the team's preseason practices.[58] Once he was able to practice, Coach Eddie Sutton related that he lacked the conditioning to finish most practices.[59] The Lexington Herald-Leader's Jerry Tipton later reported that Farmer had to leave practice half an hour early two days a week to attend his American History class.[60] Sutton also opined that Farmer's high school competition was inferior to that of Los Angeles native Mills, but Farmer's high school coach pointed out that, during Farmer's senior season, 20 of his team's games were against teams ranked in the top 20 in their respective states.[60][61]"", ""In April 2004, Farmer announced the formation of a committee to study the effectiveness of state owned and operated farmer's markets.[199] In June 2005, he was elected secretary of the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture; in 2007, he was elected president of the organization.[200][201] Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis virus in the state's horses and cattle by banning the import of animals from 20 western counties where the virus was known to have infected animals.[202] On Farmer's advice, Governor Ernie Fletcher requested that the United States Department of Agriculture designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after an April 2007 cold snap devastated the state's fruit and wheat crops; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low-interest federal loans to help compensate for their lost crop revenue.[203][204][205]"", 'Following the resignation of Lieutenant Governor Steve Pence in June 2006, Farmer was mentioned as a possible running mate for Fletcher in his upcoming re-election campaign, but Fletcher chose Robbie Rudolph instead, and Farmer announced his intent to seek re-election as agriculture commissioner.[211][212] In the Republican primary, Farmer faced Don Stosberg, a former budget analyst for Kentucky\'s Legislative Research Commission.[201] Again, Farmer was criticized for failing to appear at several campaign events; Stosberg told the Lexington Herald-Leader, ""[Farmer is] famous for three things: shooting three-point shots, not returning phone calls and not showing up.""[213] Farmer responded that he was carrying out the duties of his office during his absences from the events.[213] Farmer countered his absences by outspending his opponent 35-to-1, investing a reported $102,000 in his campaign.[214] Farmer captured 85% of the vote, defeating Stosberg by a vote of 155,576 to 26,897.[214] Name recognition played a role in both parties\' primaries: Farmer enjoyed high name recognition from his days as a basketball player, while the Democratic nominee, David Lynn Williams, had a name similar to that of Kentucky Senate President David L. Williams.[214]']"

Born in Motherwell, he played for Parkhead at junior level as an amateur and was one of the most sought-after young players in Scotland before signing for his hometown club to begin his professional career. He established himself as a consistent scorer playing as a centre forward, finishing as the top goalscorer in the Scottish Football League on three occasions between 1918 and 1921. His 284 league goals remains a record at the club and, by 1925, he was the highest-scoring player in the history of the Scottish League.', ""In 1925, Ferguson moved to Welsh side Cardiff City for £5,000 and continued his scoring exploits.

He also scored in the 1927 FA Charity Shield, during a 2–1 victory over amateur side Corinthians. Both results made Cardiff the only non-English team to have won the FA Cup or the FA Charity Shield. Despite his prolific scoring record, finishing his career with a goal average of 0.855 per game, he was never selected to play for Scotland, but did represent a Scottish League XI on three occasions."", 'Ferguson returned to Scotland with Dundee in 1929, but struggled to reproduce his goalscoring form. Six months after his arrival, he had lost his place in the team and committed suicide on 8 January 1930 at the age of 34. He is one of only seven men in the history of the English and Scottish Football Leagues to have scored 350 league goals.', 'Ferguson started his career with local youth sides in his hometown of Motherwell and represented the Dalziel School\'s team as a half back. He moved on to the Motherwell branch of the Boys\' Brigade and later Motherwell Hearts as an outside forward, helping the club reach the Scottish Juvenile Cup final. He joined Glasgow-based Parkhead in 1914,[2][3] when he switched to playing as a centre forward. He appeared for the side in their victorious 1914–15 Scottish Junior Cup final over Port Glasgow Athletic Juniors. Ferguson opened the scoring after 20 minutes by hitting a first-time shot past the opposition goalkeeper, which The Sunday Post described as ""a capital goal"". Parkhead went on to win the match 2–0.[4] At the end of his first season with Parkhead, he was chosen in a Glasgow Junior League XI against a Rest of Scotland XI and scored three of his side\'s goals in a 5–1 victory. The Midlothian Journal remarked that Ferguson was ""in a class by himself"".[5] He entered into contract talks with Manchester City and was on the verge of signing for the club when the First World War escalated. With the suspension of football in England, the move was cancelled.[6]', ""Ahead of the 1915–16 season, with Scottish football continuing during the First World War, Ferguson held talks with his hometown side Motherwell and missed the start of Parkhead's opening game of the campaign after extensive discussions with Motherwell manager John Hunter ran late.[7] He remained with Parkhead and by the mid-point of the campaign, Ferguson was one of the most coveted young players in the country,[8] having scored more than 30 goals in the first four months of the season,[9] and gaining the notice of several clubs.[8] He turned down a second offer to join Motherwell the same month and was due to turn out for Rangers in a benefit match a month later, but withdrew after sustaining an injury while playing for Parkhead in the Scottish Junior Cup, a tie in which he scored five times.[10][11] He was chosen to represent the Glasgow Junior League XI against a team from the Rest of Scotland for the second time in February 1916,[12] and scored one of his side's goals in a 5–2 victory.[13] The match served as a trial for the selection of a Scottish Junior side to take on their Irish counterparts in March, and Ferguson was duly selected. Against the Irish side, he was marked closely and missed several chances as his frustration over his treatment grew. He did win a penalty in the second half that he converted to seal a 2–0 win for Scotland.[14]"", 'Syd Puddefoot recalled Ferguson playing against Shettleston in a Scottish Junior Cup match that had been delayed and risked the forward missing an appointment; Ferguson proceeded to score eight times for Parkhead before feigning injury to leave the game early with the result no longer in doubt.

The team subsequently invited players from other Scottish teams to travel, with Ferguson agreeing to take part.[87][88] He scored eight goals in as many matches against opponents including Independiente, Peñarol and a Uruguay XI.[89] Ahead of the tour, the Athletic News wrote that Ferguson had been ""the most effective centre-forward in Great Britain"" during the early 1920s.[90] During the following season, he was again among the top scorers early in the year and, by the end of October, had scored 12 goals leaving him trailing only Tom Jennings of Raith Rovers.[91] Two weeks later, Ferguson was sent off in a 2–1 victory over Queen\'s Park after an altercation with an opposing defender when he retaliated against some rough play.[92] He later received a reprimand from the Scottish Football Association but avoided any further punishment.[93] Ferguson finished third in the scorers\' ranking, behind Dundee forward Dave Halliday and Jennings, registering 27 goals in 33 league appearances.[94]', ""Despite his prolific scoring record, at the beginning of the 1924–25 season, Motherwell experimented by moving Ferguson to inside right rather than his usual central position.[95] Although he frequented both positions, Ferguson maintained his scoring consistency and was one goal off being the league's highest goalscorer by late October.[96] In January 1925, Ferguson was approached to play in the United States, but refused the offer.[97] Later the same month, he scored five times in a 6–3 win against Galston in the first round of the Scottish Cup.[98] Motherwell finished the season in 18th place, their lowest ranking since before the First World War.[43] Ferguson however was the joint fourth-highest scorer in the league,[99] but remained on the transfer list as the club looked to raise funds.[100]"", ""Despite his listing, Ferguson remained with Motherwell for the start of the 1925–26 season and began the campaign by scoring a brace in a victory over Clydebank on the opening day.[101] In his final season with the club, Ferguson scored 12 times in 12 appearances,[102] leaving him one goal behind David McCrae as the second-highest scoring player in the Scottish league at the time.[103] His last goals for the club came in a 2–0 win over Hamilton in which he scored both of his side's goals.[104][105]"", 'In November 1925, officials from Welsh side Cardiff City submitted an offer for Ferguson. Their bid was rejected but they returned to meet Motherwell\'s asking price soon after;[3] Ferguson signed for a fee of £5,000, just £1,000 less than the record transfer fee at the time.[106] Such was his popularity at the Scottish club that the local steelworks closed for half an hour as the workers lined the streets to wave Ferguson off.[107] A large crowd also gathered at the train station as he departed and a salute of 21 fog signals was issued from the David Colville & Sons works as he passed.[3] Cardiff manager Fred Stewart, who was accompanying him, remarked that ""he had never seen a player given such a send-off before"".[108] Ferguson was one of three Scots signed by Cardiff in short succession, Joe Cassidy and George McLachlan both arriving for a similar £5,000 fee combined.[109] Ferguson made a goalscoring debut for the club in the Football League First Division[nb 1] on 7 November 1925 in a 5–2 win over Leicester City,[110] a match in which Cassidy scored a hat-trick.[111]', ""After scoring once in his first three appearances, Ferguson embarked on a goalscoring run. He netted seven times in his next five games, including the winning goals in matches against Bolton Wanderers, Notts County and West Bromwich Albion. In his first season, Ferguson finished as the club's top goalscorer with 19 league goals, despite having played in only half of Cardiff's matches. His tally also included his first hat-trick in the Football League during a 4–2 victory over Notts County in April 1926. Cardiff ended the campaign in 16th place, avoiding relegation.[111] The improvement in the team's attacking prowess following their new signings was credited for the improved form during the latter half of the season, Ferguson's goals being a cited as a major factor.[112]"", 'He was again the club\'s top goalscorer in the 1926–27 season, netting 26 times in 39 league games,[113] despite often playing at inside right as the club looked to fit both Ferguson and Len Davies into the starting lineup.[114] During the campaign, Ferguson was instrumental in Cardiff\'s progression to the FA Cup final. He scored twice in their first four fixtures before netting the winning goal in a fourth round replay against Chelsea by converting a penalty kick. Ahead of their fourth-round tie with reigning Cup holders Bolton Wanderers, Ferguson adopted a ""lucky"" black cat named Trixie that he had noticed wandering at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club in Southport, where the Cardiff team were staying. The cat had been following the players and was remarked as to have ""showed distinct partiality for Hughie"".[115] Ferguson tracked down the animal\'s owners and persuaded them to give the cat away in exchange for tickets to the final if Cardiff advanced.[116] In the semi-final, he scored a brace against Reading as Cardiff won 3–0 to reach the 1927 FA Cup Final.[113]', 'Having featured at inside right in all rounds leading up to the final,[114] Ferguson was switched to centre-forward for the deciding match.[113] In the 74th minute of the game, collecting a throw from the right, Ferguson hurried a tame shot toward the Arsenal goal. Dan Lewis, the Arsenal goalkeeper, appeared to collect the ball but, under pressure from the advancing Len Davies, allowed the ball to roll through his grasp; in a desperate attempt to retrieve the ball, Lewis only succeeded in knocking the ball with his elbow into his own net.[117] Ernie Curtis, the 19‑year‑old teammate of Ferguson, said of the goal:', ""Ferguson's goal led Cardiff to become the only team from outside England to have won the competition as they went on to win the match 1–0.[106] His 26 league goals and 6 in the team's FA Cup run set a new club record for goals in a season with 32. The record stood until 2003 when Robert Earnshaw scored 35 in a single season.[119] The following season, Ferguson netted seven times in his first ten league matches and also scored in a 2–1 victory over amateur side Corinthians in the 1927 FA Charity Shield on 12 October. Cardiff finished the season in sixth place but Ferguson's later months were hampered by injuries; he never played more than three consecutive league matches after the Christmas period. Despite this, he was again Cardiff's top goalscorer, netting 18 times in the league. In April 1928, he scored both goals in the final of the Welsh Cup as Cardiff defeated Bangor 2–0.[120]"", ""Ferguson scored a penalty on the opening day of the 1928–29 season to give his side a 1–1 draw against Newcastle United. In the team's second match, he set a club record for goals in a league game after scoring five times against Burnley on 1 September 1928 as Cardiff ran out 7–0 winners.[121] After eight matches, he led the First Division as its top goalscorer with ten goals.[122] His scoring saw him surpass Steve Bloomer as the highest-scoring player in Scottish and English football on 352 goals, doing so in less time.[123] He then began to suffer from persistent injury problems and, after playing in a 1–0 defeat to Aston Villa at the end of September, he made only three further appearances before Christmas.[121][124] This coincided with a drop in form for Cardiff, who scored only 7 times in their next 13 games,[121] during which the Western Mail bemoaned Ferguson's absence.[125] He made his final league appearance for Cardiff on 23 February 1929, scoring in a 2–2 draw against Manchester United.[121] With Cardiff struggling to avoid relegation and suffering financial problems, Ferguson was named as one of 12 players for whom the club was looking to obtain offers.[126] His position was further weakened by the signing of another centre-forward, Jimmy Munro.[127] Despite playing only 20 of the club's 42 league matches, Ferguson finished as Cardiff's top goalscorer for the fourth consecutive season with 14 league goals. This was also his 14th consecutive season as the top goalscorer of his team, at both Motherwell and Cardiff.[128] His last appearance for the club came on 1 May, when he played in a 3–0 defeat to Connah's Quay & Shotton in the Welsh Cup final.[121]"", 'Ferguson returned to Scotland with Dundee in June 1929. Cardiff had hoped to recoup £1,000 for him but the transfer was eventually completed for around £800.[128] Ferguson had openly expressed his preference to return to Motherwell, an option that the club considered, but the move never came to fruition.[129] He made his debut for Dundee on the opening day of the season against Falkirk,[130] and began the campaign at centre-forward but struggled to live up to his goalscoring reputation. His first goal for the club came in October, when he netted the only goal of the game against Queen\'s Park.[131] The Dundee Courier later reported that he was ""not enjoying the best of health"" at the time but played on. He was later moved to outside right before being dropped from the side entirely. His final game for the club was a 3–0 victory over Heart of Midlothian on 14 December 1929.[107][132] His performance in the match was criticised and he was subsequently dropped from the first team.[133] It was later reported that he had been suffering severe cramp in his legs that had left him struggling to sprint.[134]', 'Ferguson sank into depression and it was remarked that he displayed a ""melancholy demeanour and evident physical suffering"" in early January 1930 by his former colleagues at Motherwell.[132] He had been suffering from insomnia for several months at the end of 1929 and had become worried about his health.[135] On 8 January, he committed suicide, gassing himself at Dundee\'s ground Dens Park after remaining behind following a training session. His body was discovered the next morning by painters working at the ground. He was next to a gas ring which had been turned on, and his head was covered by an overcoat. He was rushed to Dundee Royal Infirmary but was pronounced dead.[136] His death has often been cited as being influenced by the barracking of the crowd as he failed to produce the form expected of him on his return to Scotland.[137] In his last game for Dundee, he received considerable criticism from the crowd as he struggled with cramp. The Dundee Evening Telegraph remarked that, for Ferguson, ""the experience of that afternoon was tremendously painful.""[138] William McIntosh, a director of Dundee, commented that ""(Ferguson) did his best for Dundee and he took his failure to heart. His lack of success was certainly not due to lack of trying \xa0... lately he became obsessed with the idea that his usefulness as a footballer had come to an end.""[136]', 'Aged 34, Ferguson left behind his wife Jessie and two children.[106] Jessie was pregnant with the couple\'s third child at the time.[137] His family have attributed his death to ""an imbalance of his inner-ear"" that had affected his balance and had led to his poor form. They believe this was caused by an undiagnosed brain tumour.[107][137] Ferguson\'s body was moved from Dundee to Motherwell; four of his Dundee teammates carried his coffin to a waiting hearse while the remainder of the squad watched on. A small service was held at his home before he was buried in Airbles Cemetery in his hometown of Motherwell.[139]', ""Ferguson was born in Motherwell on 2 March 1895 and had six brothers and one sister.[110][135][140] His father was killed in a colliery accident when Ferguson was 16.[141] He married Jessie Andrews on 21 March 1924 in his hometown.[142] His uncle, also named Hugh Ferguson, was a politician and served as a Member of Parliament for Motherwell and he sometimes assisted his uncle at political gatherings.[135][136] Ferguson's son Jack later went on to represent Britain in water polo at the 1952 and 1956 Olympics.[143] His daughter Sadie later married Dunfermline player James Hogg, brother of Scottish international Bobby Hogg.[144]"", 'Ferguson was regarded as a clean-living player, he was teetotal, never smoked and attended church.[145] He was also interested in and kept birds, displaying them in competitions organised by the Motherwell and District Cage Bird Association. He won his category while finishing runner-up in another in 1923 with a goldfinch mule and won several awards the following year.[146][147]', 'Ferguson\'s main attribute was his finishing ability; the Sporting Chronicle noted after his senior debut for Motherwell in 1916 that he ""possessed all the physical qualities required in a centre-forward, and is unquestionably a fine marksman"".[148] At the end of his first senior season, the Daily Record wrote ""Hugh can draw out the opposition, he can get a fair amount of work on the ball and he never forgets where the goal lies"". The paper also referred to his physicality, noting that while it was not a major aspect of his game ""he is no pigmy. He can take a knock, he can return one.""[2] Upon his signing for Cardiff in 1925, the Western Mail described him as ""not a particularly big man but he is very wiry and nippy"".[108]', 'He was also renowned for his modesty and sense of fair play.[107] John Hunter, who managed Ferguson at Motherwell, described him as ""irreproachable in conduct, a fine upright fellow, he was above all else a gentleman.""[135] One such example of this came in a league match against Hibernian while playing for Motherwell. Opposition goalkeeper Bill Harper had sustained an injury and the opportunity came to Ferguson to take advantage of this when he struggled to gather the ball from a cross. Rather than capitalise on Harper\'s misfortune, Ferguson allowed the keeper to recover and stop a certain goal.[135]', 'Despite his performances for Motherwell, Ferguson was never selected for the Scotland national side.[149] At the time of his departure from the club in 1925, Ferguson was the highest scoring player in the history of the Scottish League. He was later surpassed by Jimmy McGrory and Bob McPhail.[150] He is one of only seven players to have scored more than 350 league goals in the history of Scottish and English football,[150][151][152] finishing his career with a goal ratio per game of 0.855.[107]', 'For many years Ferguson held the Motherwell club record for scoring goals in consecutive games, until it was broken by Kevin van Veen in 2023.[153]', 'Cardiff City[110]', 'Individual', 'Bibliography']"

Despite his party's emphasis on anti-immigration and anti-Catholic policies, during his candidacy in the 1856 presidential election, he said little about immigration, focusing on the preservation of the Union, and won only Maryland. During the American Civil War, Fillmore denounced secession and agreed that the Union must be maintained by force if necessary, but was critical of Abraham Lincoln's war policies. After peace was restored, he supported President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policies. Fillmore remained involved in civic interests after his presidency, including as chancellor of the University of Buffalo, which he had helped found in 1846. Historians usually rank Fillmore among the worst presidents in American history, largely for his policies regarding slavery, as well as among the least memorable. His association with the Know Nothings and support of Johnson's reconstruction policies further tarnished his reputation."", ""Many Anti-Masons were opposed to the presidential candidacy of General Andrew Jackson, who was a Mason. Fillmore was a delegate to the New York convention that endorsed President John Quincy Adams for re-election and also served at two Anti-Masonic conventions in the summer of 1828.[1] At the conventions, Fillmore first met political boss and future rival Thurlow Weed, then a newspaper editor, where they reportedly impressed one another.[29] Fillmore was the leading citizen in East Aurora, having successfully sought election to the New York State Assembly, and served in Albany for three one-year terms (1829 to 1831).[1] Fillmore's 1828 election contrasted the victories of the Jacksonian Democrats (soon the Democrats), who swept the general into the White House and their party to a majority in Albany and so Fillmore was in the minority in the Assembly.[30] He proved effective anyway by promoting legislation to provide court witnesses the option of taking a non-religious oath and, in 1830, abolishing imprisonment for debt.[11] By then much of Fillmore's legal practice was in Buffalo, and later that year he moved there with his family. He did not seek re-election in 1831.[29][31]"", ""In 1832 Fillmore ran successfully for the U.S. House of Representatives. The Anti-Masonic presidential candidate, William Wirt, a former attorney general, won only Vermont, and President Jackson easily gained re-election. At the time, Congress convened its annual session in December and so Fillmore had to wait more than a year after his election to take his seat. Fillmore, Weed, and others realized that opposition to Masonry was too narrow a foundation to build a national party. They formed the broad-based Whig Party from National Republicans, Anti-Masons, and disaffected Democrats. The Whigs were initially united by their opposition to Jackson but became a major party by expanding their platform to include support for economic growth through rechartering the Second Bank of the United States and federally-funded internal improvements, including roads, bridges, and canals.[35] Weed had joined the Whigs before Fillmore and became a power within the party, and Weed's anti-slavery views were stronger than those of Fillmore, who disliked slavery but considered the federal government powerless over it. They were closer to those of another prominent New York Whig, William H. Seward of Auburn, who was also seen as a Weed protégé.[2]"", ""Anti-Masonry was still strong in Western New York though it was petering out nationally. When the Anti-Masons did not nominate him for a second term in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for the state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate.[40] Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons.[41] By 1836 Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.[42]"", ""Anti-Masonry was still strong in Western New York though it was petering out nationally.

Vice President Tyler was elevated to the presidency; the onetime maverick Democrat soon broke with Clay over congressional proposals for a national bank to stabilize the currency, which he vetoed twice and so was expelled from the Whig Party.

Polk for president. Although Fillmore worked to gain support among German-Americans, a major constituency, he was hurt among immigrants by the fact that in New York City, Whigs had supported a nativist candidate in the mayoral election earlier in 1844, and Fillmore and his party were tarred with that brush.[56] He was not friendly to immigrants and blamed his defeat on ""foreign Catholics"".[57] Clay was beaten as well.[55] Fillmore\'s biographer Paul Finkelman suggested that Fillmore\'s hostility to immigrants and his weak position on slavery had defeated him for governor.[58]', 'In 1846 Fillmore was involved in the founding of what is now the University at Buffalo (earlier the University of Buffalo), became its first chancellor, and served until his death in 1874. He had opposed the annexation of Texas, spoke against the subsequent Mexican–American War, and saw the war as a contrivance to extend slavery\'s realm. Fillmore was angered when President Polk vetoed a river and harbors bill that would have benefited Buffalo,[59] and he wrote, ""May God save the country for it is evident the people will not.""[60] At the time, New York governors served a two-year term, and Fillmore could have had the Whig nomination in 1846 had he wanted it. He actually came within one vote of it while he maneuvered to get the nomination for his supporter, John Young, who was elected. A new constitution for New York State provided the office of comptroller to be made elective, as were the attorney general and some other positions that were formerly chosen by the state legislature. Fillmore\'s work in finance as the Ways and Means chairman made him an obvious candidate for comptroller, and he was successful in getting the Whig nomination for the 1847 election.[61] With a united party at his back, Fillmore won by 38,000 votes, the largest margin that a Whig candidate for statewide office would ever achieve in New York.[62]', ""President Polk had pledged not to seek a second term, and with gains in Congress during the 1846 election cycle, the Whigs were hopeful of taking the White House in 1848. The party's perennial candidates, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, both wanted the nomination and amassed support from congressional colleagues. Many rank-and-file Whigs backed the Mexican War hero, General Zachary Taylor, for president. Although Taylor was extremely popular, many Northerners had qualms about electing a Louisiana slaveholder at a time of sectional tension over whether slavery should be allowed in the territories that had been ceded by Mexico. Taylor's uncertain political views gave others pause: his career in the Army had prevented him from ever casting a ballot for president though he stated that he was a Whig supporter. Some feared that they might elect another Tyler, or another Harrison.[64]"", 'With the nomination undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York to send an uncommitted delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia in the hope of being a kingmaker in a position to place ex-Governor Seward on the ticket or to get him a high federal office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an uncommitted ticket but did not tell the Buffalonian of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor with whom Fillmore tended to co-operate for the greater good of the Whig Party. However, Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward and did not want to see him gain high office.[65]', ""It was customary in the mid-19th century for a candidate for high office not to appear to seek it. Thus, Fillmore remained at the comptroller's office in Albany and made no speeches. The 1848 campaign was conducted in the newspapers and with addresses made by surrogates at rallies. The Democrats nominated Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan for president, with General William O. Butler as his running mate, but it became a three-way fight since the Free Soil Party, which opposed the spread of slavery, chose ex-President Van Buren.[70] There was a crisis among the Whigs when Taylor also accepted the presidential nomination of a group of dissident South Carolina Democrats. Fearing that Taylor would be a party apostate like Tyler, Weed in late August scheduled a rally in Albany aimed at electing an uncommitted slate of presidential electors. Fillmore interceded with the editor and assured him that Taylor was loyal to the party.[71][72]"", 'Fillmore presided[g] over some of the most momentous and passionate debates in American history as the Senate debated whether to allow slavery in the territories. The ongoing sectional conflict had already excited much discussion when on January 21, 1850, President Taylor sent a special message to Congress that urged the admission of California immediately and New Mexico later and for the Supreme Court to settle the boundary dispute whereby the state of Texas claimed much of what is now the state of New Mexico.[83] On January 29, Clay introduced his ""Omnibus Bill"",[h] which would give victories to both North and South by admitting California as a free state, organizing territorial governments in New Mexico and Utah, and banning the slave trade in the District of Columbia. The bill would also toughen the Fugitive Slave Act, as resistance to enforcement in parts of the North had been a longtime Southern grievance. Clay\'s bill provided for the settlement of the Texas–New Mexico boundary dispute, and the status of slavery in the territories would be decided by those living there, the concept being known as popular sovereignty. Taylor was unenthusiastic about the bill, which languished in Congress. After hearing weeks of debate, however, Fillmore informed him in May 1850 that if senators divided equally on the bill, he would cast his tie-breaking vote in favor.[1] Fillmore did his best to keep the peace among the senators and reminded them of the vice president\'s power to rule them out of order, but he was blamed for failing to maintain the peace when a physical confrontation between Mississippi\'s Henry S. Foote and Missouri\'s Thomas Hart Benton broke out on April 17. Before other senators intervened to separate them, Foote pointed a gun at his colleague as Benton advanced on him.[84]', 'July 4, 1850 was a very hot day in Washington, and President Taylor, who attended the Fourth of July ceremonies to lay the cornerstone of the Washington Monument, refreshed himself, likely with cold milk and cherries. What he consumed likely gave him gastroenteritis, and he died on July 9. Taylor, nicknamed ""Old Rough and Ready"", had gained a reputation for toughness through his military campaigning in the heat, and his sudden death came as a shock to the nation.[85]', ""Fillmore had been called from his chair presiding over the Senate on July 8 and had sat with members of the cabinet in a vigil outside Taylor's bedroom at the White House. He received the formal notification of the president's death, signed by the cabinet, on the evening of July 9 in his residence at the Willard Hotel. After acknowledging the letter and spending a sleepless night,[86] Fillmore went to the House of Representatives, where, at a joint session of Congress, he took the oath as president from William Cranch, the chief judge of the federal court for the District of Columbia, who had also sworn in President Tyler. The cabinet officers, as was customary when a new president took over, submitted their resignations but expected Fillmore to refuse and to allow them to continue in office. Fillmore had been marginalized by the cabinet members, and he accepted the resignations though he asked them to stay on for a month, which most refused to do. Fillmore is the only president who succeeded by death or resignation not to retain, at least initially, his predecessor's cabinet. He was already in discussions with Whig leaders and, on July 20, began to send new nominations to the Senate, with the Fillmore Cabinet to be led by Webster as Secretary of State. Webster had outraged his Massachusetts constituents by supporting Clay's bill and, with his Senate term to expire in 1851, had no political future in his home state. Fillmore appointed his old law partner, Nathan Hall, as Postmaster General, a cabinet position that controlled many patronage appointments.[87] The new department heads were mostly supporters of the Compromise, like Fillmore.[88]"", ""The brief pause from politics out of national grief at Taylor's death did not abate the crisis. Texas had attempted to assert its authority in New Mexico, and the state's governor, Peter H. Bell, had sent belligerent letters to President Taylor.[89] Fillmore received another letter after he had become president. He reinforced federal troops in the area and warned Bell to keep the peace.[88]"", ""Fillmore sent a special message to Congress on August 6, 1850; disclosed the letter from Governor Bell and his reply; warned that armed Texans would be viewed as intruders; and urged Congress to defuse sectional tensions by passing the Compromise. Without the presence of the Great Triumvirate of John C. Calhoun, Webster, and Clay, who had long dominated the Senate,[i] Douglas and others were able to lead the Senate towards the administration-backed package of bills. Each bill passed the Senate with the support of the section that wanted it, with a few members who were determined to see all the bills passed. The battle then moved to the House, which had a Northern majority because of the population. Most contentious was the Fugitive Slave Bill, whose provisions were anathema to abolitionists. Fillmore applied pressure to get Northern Whigs, including New Yorkers, to abstain, rather than to oppose the bill. Through the legislative process, various changes were made, including the setting of a boundary between New Mexico Territory and Texas, the state being given a payment to settle any claims. California was admitted as a free state, the District of Columbia's slave trade was ended, and the final status of slavery in New Mexico and Utah would be settled later. Fillmore signed the bills as they reached his desk and held the Fugitive Slave Bill for two days until he received a favorable opinion as to its constitutionality from the new Attorney General, John J. Crittenden. Although some Northerners were unhappy at the Fugitive Slave Act, relief was widespread in the hope of settling the slavery question.[91][92]"", ""Justice John McKinley's death in 1852 led to repeated fruitless attempts by the president to fill the vacancy. The Senate took no action on the nomination of the New Orleans attorney Edward A. Bradford. Fillmore's second choice, George Edmund Badger, asked for his name to be withdrawn. Senator-elect Judah P. Benjamin declined to serve. The nomination of William C. Micou, a New Orleans lawyer recommended by Benjamin, was not acted on by the Senate. The vacancy was finally filled after Fillmore's term, when President Franklin Pierce nominated John Archibald Campbell, who was confirmed by the Senate.[100]"", ""Fillmore had become unpopular with northern Whigs for signing and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act but still had considerable support from the South, where he was seen as the only candidate capable of uniting the party. Once the convention passed a party platform endorsing the Compromise as a final settlement of the slavery question, Fillmore was willing to withdraw. He found that many of his supporters could not accept Webster and that his action would nominate Scott. The convention was deadlocked until Saturday, June 19, when a total of 46 ballots had been taken, and the delegates adjourned until Monday. Party leaders proposed a deal to Fillmore and Webster: if the latter could increase his vote total over the next several ballots, enough Fillmore supporters would go along to put him over the top. Otherwise, Webster would withdraw in favor of Fillmore. The President quickly agreed, but Webster did not do so until Monday morning. On the 48th ballot, Webster delegates began to defect to Scott, and the general gained the nomination on the 53rd ballot. Webster was far more unhappy at the outcome than was Fillmore, who refused the secretary's resignation. Without the votes of much of the South and also of Northerners who depended on peaceful intersectional trade, Scott was easily beaten by Pierce in November. Smith suggested that the Whigs might have done much better with Fillmore.[107]"", ""Fillmore was the first president to return to private life without independent wealth or the possession of a landed estate. With no pension to anticipate, he needed to earn a living and felt that it should be in a way that would uphold the dignity of his former office. His friend Judge Hall assured him it would be proper for him to practice law in the higher courts of New York, and Fillmore so intended.[109] The Fillmores had planned a tour of the South after they had left the White House, but Abigail caught a cold at President Pierce's inauguration, developed pneumonia, and died in Washington on March 30, 1853. A saddened Fillmore returned to Buffalo for the burial.[110] The fact that he was in mourning limited his social activities, and he made ends meet on the income from his investments.[111] He was bereaved again on July 26, 1854, when his only daughter, Mary, died of cholera.[112]"", ""Fillmore's allies were in full control of the American Party and arranged for him to get its presidential nomination while he was in Europe. The Know Nothing convention chose Fillmore's running mate: Andrew Donelson of Kentucky, the nephew by marriage and once-ward of President Jackson. Fillmore made a celebrated return in June 1856 by speaking at a series of welcomes, which began with his arrival at a huge reception in New York City and continued across the state to Buffalo. The addresses were portrayed as expressions of thanks for his reception, rather than as campaign speeches, which might be considered illicit office-seeking if they were made by a presidential hopeful. Fillmore warned that electing the Republican candidate, former California senator John C. Frémont, who had no support in the South, would divide the Union and lead to civil war. Both Fillmore and the Democratic candidate, former Pennsylvania senator James Buchanan, agreed that slavery was principally a matter for the states, not the federal government. Fillmore rarely spoke about the immigration question, focused on the sectional divide, and urged the preservation of the Union.[121][122]"", ""After Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, black ink was thrown on Fillmore's house because it was not draped in mourning like others. Fillmore was apparently out of town at the time and put black drapes in the windows once he returned. He retained his position as Buffalo's leading citizen and was among those selected to escort the body when Lincoln's funeral train passed through Buffalo, but many remained angry at him for his wartime positions.[138] Fillmore supported President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policies since he felt that the nation needed to be reconciled as quickly as possible.[139] He devoted most of his time to civic activities. He aided Buffalo in becoming the third American city to have a permanent art gallery, the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy.[140]"", 'Fillmore is ranked by historians and political scientists as one of the worst U.S. presidents.[143] His handling of major political issues, such as slavery, has led many historians to describe him as weak and inept.[143] According to biographer Scarry: ""No president of the United States\xa0... has suffered as much ridicule as Millard Fillmore.""[144] Scarry ascribes much of the abuse to a tendency to denigrate the presidents who served in the years just before the Civil War as lacking in leadership. For example, President Harry S. Truman later ""characterized Fillmore as a weak, trivial thumb-twaddler who would do nothing to offend anyone"" and as partially responsible for the war.[145] Fillmore\'s name has become a byword in popular culture for easily forgotten and inconsequential presidents.[146] In 2010, Anna Prior wrote in The Wall Street Journal that Fillmore\'s very name connotes mediocrity.[147] Finkelman, another Fillmore biographer, comments, ""on the central issues of the age his vision was myopic and his legacy is worse\xa0... in the end, Fillmore was always on the wrong side of the great moral and political issues.""[148] But Rayback applauds ""the warmth and wisdom with which he had defended the Union"",[149] and Smith finds Fillmore ""a conscientious president"" who honored his oath of office by enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act rather than govern based on his personal preferences.[150] Steven G. Calabresi and Christopher S. Yoo, in their study of presidential power, deem Fillmore ""a faithful executor of the laws of the United States\xa0– for good and for ill"".[151] But according to Smith, the enforcement of the Act has given Fillmore an undeserved pro-southern reputation. Fillmore\'s place in history has also suffered because ""even those who give him high marks for his support of the compromise have done so almost grudgingly, probably because of his Know-Nothing candidacy in 1856.""[152] Smith argues that Fillmore\'s association with the Know Nothings looks far worse in retrospect than at the time and that Fillmore was not motivated by nativism in his candidacy,[153] despite the letter he wrote for publication that stoked fear about immigrant influence in elections.[116]', ""Fillmore and his wife, Abigail, established the first White House library.[160] There are a number of remembrances of Fillmore; his East Aurora house still stands, and sites honor him at his birthplace and boyhood home, where the Millard Fillmore Memorial Association dedicated a replica log cabin in 1963.[161] A statue of Fillmore stands outside Buffalo City Hall.[162] On February 18, 2010, the United States Mint released the 13th coin in the Presidential $1 Coin Program, bearing Fillmore's likeness.[147][163]"", ""Any assessment of a President who served a century and a half ago must be refracted through a consideration of the interesting times in which he lived. Fillmore's political career encompassed the tortuous course toward the two-party system that we know today. The Whigs were not cohesive enough to survive the slavery imbroglio, while parties like the Anti-Masonics and Know-Nothings were too extremist. When, as President, Fillmore sided with proslavery elements in ordering enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law, he all but guaranteed that he would be the last Whig President. The first modern two-party system of Whigs and Democrats had succeeded only in dividing the nation in two by the 1850s, and seven years later, the election of the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, would guarantee civil war.""]"

Foraker zealously opposed Roosevelt's actions as unfair, and fought for the soldiers' reinstatement.

Foster had sought increased regulation of the liquor trade, offending many German-Americans, who were deemed likely to vote Democratic in reaction, and who were especially concentrated in Cincinnati.  Few expected the Republicans to retain the governorship, and prominent candidates such as Senator John Sherman and Congressman Benjamin Butterworth declined to run.  Foster saw Foraker as a candidate likely to do well:  he was a Civil War veteran with a good record as a lawyer and a promising public speaker—and his Cincinnati residence might win back some votes.  Others agreed; the local United States attorney wrote to Senator Sherman that the Republicans should nominate ""Foraker or some other unobjectionable man"".[26]  Foster accordingly wrote to Foraker, offering him the chance at ""honorable distinction and useful service.""[27]  Foraker came to Columbus just before the 1883 state convention, and sounded out state Republican leaders such as Sherman and Congressman William McKinley.  When Foraker found them willing to support him, he allowed his name to be placed in nomination, and once it was clear that Sherman would not run, the convention nominated Foraker by acclamation.  The Democratic Cincinnati Enquirer summed up the Republican strategy:  ""They determined to sacrifice as little as possible, so they sacrificed Foraker.""[28]', 'Foraker had little involvement in politics in 1893 and 1894, concentrating on the law.

The convention also endorsed Foraker for Senate, the first time a specific individual had been backed for Senate by an Ohio Republican convention.  According to Walters, ""The Zanesville convention represented the highest pinnicle of Foraker\'s power in Ohio politics.  He had selected the platform, chosen the next governor and the complete ticket, and had secured for himself virtual election to the United States Senate.""[80]    Foraker took a leading role as a speaker in the campaign, and the November election resulted in victory for Bushnell and a Republican majority in the legislature.[81]   That majority, on January 15, 1896, elected Joseph Foraker to the Senate.[82]', 'In 1913, ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution changed the method of choosing senators from legislative vote to election by the people.[150]  Buoyed by positive reviews of his participation in the 1912 campaign, and wishing to avenge his defeat for re-election, Foraker entered the 1914 Republican primary against Senator Burton and former congressman Ralph D.

Most of his contacts were still with scientists in Germany; especially notable is his dispute with Immanuel Kant about the definition of race.[54] In 1785, Forster traveled to Halle where he submitted his thesis on the plants of the South Pacific for a doctorate in medicine.[55] Back in Vilnius, Forster's ambitions to build a real natural history scientific centre could not get appropriate financial support from the authorities in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Moreover, his famous speech on natural history in 1785 went almost unnoticed and was not printed until 1843. These events led to high tensions between him and the local community.[56] Eventually, he broke the contract six years short of its completion as Catherine II of Russia had offered him a place on a journey around the world (the Mulovsky expedition) for a high honorarium and a position as a professor in Saint Petersburg.[57] This resulted in a conflict between Forster and the influential Polish scientist Jędrzej Śniadecki. However, the Russian proposal was withdrawn and Forster left Vilnius.

His competitors, who performed on accordions and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when he stepped forward to perform on the sodina.

Frederick\'s father, Prince Wilhelm, was the second son of King Frederick Wilhelm III and, having been raised in the military traditions of the Hohenzollerns, developed into a strict disciplinarian. William fell in love with his cousin Elisa Radziwill, a princess of the Polish nobility, but the court felt Elisa\'s rank was not suitable for the bride of a Prussian prince and forced a more suitable match.[2] The woman selected to be his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar, had been raised in the more intellectual and artistic atmosphere of Weimar, which gave its citizens greater participation in politics and limited the powers of its rulers through a constitution;[3][4] Augusta was well known across Europe for her liberal views.[5] Because of their differences, the couple did not have a happy marriage and,[3][4] as a result, Frederick grew up in a troubled household, which left him with memories of a lonely childhood.[3][6] He had one sister, Louise (later Grand Duchess of Baden), who was seven years his junior and very close to him. Frederick also had a very good relationship with his uncle, the future King Frederick William IV, who has been called ""the romantic on the throne"".[7]', ""In 1871, following Prussia's victories, the German states were united into the German Empire, with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent to the new German monarchy.

Later the same day, Frederick wrote in his diary that he had received the telegram upon returning from a walk, ""...and so I have ascended the throne of my forefathers and of the German Kaiser! God help me fulfill my duties conscientiously and for the weal of my Fatherland, in both the narrower and the wider sense.""[79] Germany\'s progressive elements hoped that William\'s death, and thus Frederick\'s succession, would usher the country into a new era governed along liberal lines.[52][80] Logically, Frederick should have taken as his regnal name either Frederick I (if the Bismarckian empire was considered a new entity) or Frederick IV (if it was considered a continuation of the old Holy Roman Empire, which had had three emperors named Frederick); he himself preferred the latter. However, on the advice of Bismarck that this would create legal problems, he opted to simply keep the same regnal name he had as king of Prussia.[79] The new emperor reached Berlin at 11 p.m. on the night of 11 March; those who saw him were horrified by his ""pitiful"" appearance.[81] The question now was how much longer the mortally ill emperor could be expected to live, and what, if anything, he could hope to achieve.[79] In spite of his illness, Frederick did his best to fulfill his obligations as emperor. Immediately after the announcement of his accession, he took the ribbon and star of his Order of the Black Eagle from his uniform tunic and pinned it on the dress of his wife; he was determined to honor her position as empress.[82] Too ill to march in his father\'s funeral procession, he was represented by Wilhelm, the new Crown Prince, while he watched, weeping, from his rooms in the Charlottenburg Palace.[81]', 'Although celebrated as a young man for his leadership and successes during the Second Schleswig, Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars,[95][50] he nevertheless professed a hatred of warfare and was praised by friends and enemies alike for his humane conduct. Frederick believed a state should not act against the popular opinion of its inhabitants.[33][96] He had a long history of liberalism, and had discussed his ideas and intentions with Victoria and others before his reign. Admiring Prince Albert and the British parliamentary system,[52][97] Frederick and his wife planned to rule as co-monarchs and liberalize Germany through the appointment of more liberal ministers.[98] They intended to severely limit the office of Chancellor,[86] and reorganize Germany to include many elements of British liberalism. Many historians, including William Harbutt Dawson and Erich Eyck, consider that Frederick\'s early death put an end to the development of liberalism within the German Empire.[99] They believe that, given a longer reign and better health, Frederick might indeed have transformed Germany into a more liberal democratic country, and prevented its militaristic path toward war.[83][100][101] Dr. J. McCullough claims that Frederick would have averted World War I—and by extension the resulting Weimar Republic[101]—while other historians such as Michael Balfour go even further by postulating that, as the end of World War I directly affected the state of the world\'s development, the liberal German Emperor might also have prevented the rise of Adolf Hitler and by extent, preventing the outbreak of World War II.[102] Author Michael Freund states outright that both world wars would have been averted had Frederick lived longer.[103] Frederick\'s life inspired historian Frank Tipton to speculate: ""What would have happened had his father died sooner or if he himself had lived longer?""[104]', ""Frederick's children—Wilhelm in particular—held various political positions and greatly influenced Europe. Unlike his father, Wilhelm had not personally experienced the horrors of war, and he enthusiastically embraced his family's military heritage, coming under Bismarck's tutelage. The Chancellor, who disapproved of Frederick's and Victoria's liberal ways, felt bound to increase the tensions between Wilhelm and his parents.[111] Wilhelm grew up full of disdain for their opinions on government; shortly after his father's death he proclaimed that he would follow the path of his grandfather, William I, and made no reference to Frederick III.[112] Wilhelm II abandoned all of his father's policies and ideas, and eventually led Germany into World War I.[99][110]"", 'The Crown Prince and Princess shared the outlook of the Progressive Party, and Bismarck was haunted by the fear that should the old Emperor die—and he was now in his seventies—they would call on one of the Progressive leaders to become Chancellor. He sought to guard against such a turn by keeping the Crown Prince from a position of any influence and by using foul means as well as fair to make him unpopular.[116]']"

Testifying before the committee in January, Ames said he had offered Garfield ten shares of stock at par value, but that Garfield had never taken them or paid for them, though a year passed, from 1867 to 1868, before Garfield had finally refused. Appearing before the committee on January 14, 1873, Garfield confirmed much of this. Ames testified several weeks later that Garfield agreed to take the stock on credit, and that it was paid for by the company's huge dividends.[115] The two men differed over $300 that Garfield received and later paid back, with Garfield deeming it a loan and Ames a dividend.[116]"", 'In 1876, Garfield developed a trapezoid proof of the Pythagorean theorem, which was published in the New England Journal of Education.[140] Mathematics historian William Dunham wrote that Garfield\'s trapezoid work was ""really a very clever proof.""[141] According to the Journal, Garfield arrived at the proof ""in mathematical amusements and discussions with other members of congress.""[142]', 'Garfield believed the key to improving the state of African American civil rights was government supported education.[185] During Reconstruction, freedmen had gained citizenship and suffrage, which enabled them to participate in government, but Garfield believed their rights were being eroded by Southern white resistance and illiteracy, and he was concerned that blacks would become America\'s permanent ""peasantry"".[186] He proposed a ""universal"" education system funded by the federal government. In February 1866, Garfield and Ohio School Commissioner Emerson Edward White drafted a bill for the National Department of Education. They believed that through the use of statistics they could push the US Congress to establish a federal agency for school reform.[187] But Congress and the northern white public had lost interest in African-American rights, and Congress did not pass federal funding for universal education during Garfield\'s term.[186] Garfield also worked to appoint several African Americans to prominent positions: Frederick Douglass, recorder of deeds in Washington; Robert Elliot, special agent to the Treasury; John M. Langston, Haitian minister; and Blanche K. Bruce, register to the Treasury. Garfield believed Southern support for the Republican Party could be gained by ""commercial and industrial"" interests rather than race issues and began to reverse Hayes\'s policy of conciliating Southern Democrats.[188] He appointed William H. Hunt, a carpetbagger Republican from Louisiana, as Secretary of the Navy.[188] To break the hold of the resurgent Democratic Party in the Solid South, Garfield took patronage advice from Virginia Senator William Mahone of the biracial independent Readjuster Party, hoping to add the independents\' strength to the Republicans\' there.[189]', 'Garfield was struck by two shots: one glanced off his arm while the other pierced his back, shattering a rib and embedding itself in his abdomen. ""My God, what is this?"" he exclaimed.[213] Among those at the station was Robert Todd Lincoln, who was deeply upset, thinking back to when his father Abraham Lincoln was assassinated 16 years earlier. Garfield was taken on a mattress upstairs to a private office, where several doctors examined him. At his request, Garfield was taken back to the White House, and his wife, then in New Jersey, was sent for.[214] Blaine sent word to Vice President Arthur in New York City, who received threats against his life because of his animosity toward Garfield and Guiteau\'s statements.[215]']"

Within the year both Sophia and Anne were dead, and George's father was king.[22]"", ""Banned from the palace and shunned by his own father, the Prince of Wales was identified for the next several years with opposition to George I's policies,[40] which included measures designed to increase religious freedom in Great Britain and expand Hanover's German territories at the expense of Sweden.[41] His new London residence, Leicester House, became a frequent meeting place for his father's political opponents, including Sir Robert Walpole and Lord Townshend, who had left the government in 1717.[42]"", ""The King visited Hanover again from May to November 1719. Instead of appointing George to the guardianship, he established a regency council.[43] In 1720, Walpole encouraged the King and his son to reconcile, for the sake of public unity, which they did half-heartedly.[44] Walpole and Townshend returned to political office, and rejoined the ministry.[45] George was soon disillusioned with the terms of the reconciliation; his three daughters who were in the care of the King were not returned and he was still barred from becoming regent during the King's absences.[46] He came to believe that Walpole had tricked him into the rapprochement as part of a scheme to regain power. Over the next few years, he and Caroline lived quietly, avoiding overt political activity. They had three more children: William, Mary, and Louisa, who were brought up at Leicester House and Richmond Lodge, George's summer residence.[47]"", ""George's French opponents encouraged rebellion by the Jacobites, the supporters of the Roman Catholic claimant to the British throne, James Francis Edward Stuart, often known as the Old Pretender. Stuart was the son of James II, who had been deposed in 1688 and replaced by his Protestant relations. Two prior rebellions in 1715 and 1719 had failed. In July 1745, the Old Pretender's son, Charles Edward Stuart, popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, landed in Scotland, where support for his cause was highest. George, who was summering in Hanover, returned to London at the end of August.[97] The Jacobites defeated British forces in September at the Battle of Prestonpans, and then moved south into England. The Jacobites failed to gain further support, and the French reneged on a promise of help. Losing morale, the Jacobites retreated back into Scotland.[98] On 16/27 April 1746, Charles faced George's military-minded son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, in the Battle of Culloden, the last pitched battle fought on British soil. The ravaged Jacobite troops were routed by the government army. Charles escaped to France, but many of his supporters were caught and executed. Jacobitism was all but crushed; no further serious attempt was made at restoring the House of Stuart.[99] The War of the Austrian Succession continued until 1748, when Maria Theresa was recognized as Archduchess of Austria. The peace was celebrated by a fête in Green Park, London, for which Handel composed Music for the Royal Fireworks.[100]""]"

The Acts of Union 1800 unified Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with George as its king. He was concurrently Duke and Prince-elector of Hanover in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was a monarch of the House of Hanover, who, unlike his two predecessors, was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language,[1] and never visited Hanover.[2]', 'In the later part of his life, George had recurrent and eventually permanent mental illness. The exact nature of the mental illness is not known definitively, but historians and medical experts have suggested that his symptoms and behaviour traits were consistent with bipolar disorder or porphyria. In 1810, George suffered a final relapse, and his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, was named Prince Regent the following year. The King died aged 81, at which time the Regent succeeded him as George IV. George III reigned during much of the Georgian and Regency eras. At the time of his death, he was the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch, having reigned for 59 years and 96 days; he remains the longest-lived and longest-reigning male monarch in British history.', ""George was born in Norfolk House in St James's Square, London, on 4 June 1738.[c] He was a grandson of King George II and the eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. As he was born two months prematurely, and thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by Thomas Secker, who was both Rector of St James's Church, Piccadilly, and Bishop of Oxford.[3][4] One month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were King Frederick I of Sweden (for whom Lord Baltimore stood proxy), his uncle Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha (for whom Lord Carnarvon stood proxy), and his great-aunt Sophia Dorothea, Queen in Prussia (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin stood proxy).[5]"", ""The King and Queen had 15 children—nine sons and six daughters. In 1762, George purchased Buckingham House (on the site now occupied by Buckingham Palace) for use as a family retreat.[20] His other residences were Kew Palace and Windsor Castle. St James's Palace was retained for official use. He did not travel extensively and spent his entire life in southern England. In the 1790s, the King and his family took holidays at Weymouth, Dorset,[21] which he thus popularised as one of the first seaside resorts in England.[22]"", 'George, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: ""Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.""[23] He inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain.[24] During George III\'s lengthy reign, Britain was a constitutional monarchy, ruled by his ministerial government and prominent men in Parliament.[25] Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties,[e] the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years\' War.[27] George came to be perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat.[1]', ""In May 1762, the incumbent Whig government of Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, was replaced with one led by Lord Bute, a Scottish Tory. Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny that he was having an affair with the King's mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish sentiment amongst the English.[36] John Wilkes, a member of parliament, published The North Briton, which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons and found guilty in absentia of blasphemy and libel.[37] In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power. Britain received enormous concessions, including West Florida. Britain restored to France lucrative slave-sugar islands in the West Indies, including Guadeloupe and Martinique. France ceded Canada to Britain, in addition to all land between the Allegheny Mountains and the Mississippi River, except New Orleans, which was ceded to Spain.[38]"", ""Lord Rockingham, with the support of Pitt and the King, repealed Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act. Rockingham's government was weak, and he was replaced as prime minister in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created Earl of Chatham. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in New York City.[47] Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, and Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, took over the government. Grafton did not formally become prime minister until 1768. That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the general election, and came top of the poll in the Middlesex constituency. Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament. He was re-elected and expelled twice more, before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared the runner-up as the victor.[48] Grafton's government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories led by Lord North to return to power.[49]"", 'As late as the siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists could still believe in their eventual victory, as British troops inflicted defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House.[76] In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis\'s surrender at the siege of Yorktown reached London; North\'s parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. George drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered.[65][77] He finally accepted the defeat in America and authorized peace negotiations. Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States in the Treaties of Paris signed in 1782 and 1783.[78] In early 1783, George III privately conceded ""America is lost!"" He reflected that the Northern colonies had developed into Britain\'s ""successful rivals"" in commercial trade and fishing.[79] Up to 70,000 Loyalists fled to Canada, the Caribbean, or England.[80]', ""With the collapse of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became prime minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then appointed Lord Shelburne to replace him. Charles James Fox, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the Fox–North Coalition. Portland became prime minister, with Fox and Lord North, as foreign secretary and home secretary respectively.[8]"", 'The King disliked Fox intensely, for his politics as well as his character: he thought Fox unprincipled and a bad influence on the Prince of Wales.[82] George III was distressed at having to appoint ministers not of his liking, but the Portland ministry quickly built up a majority in the House of Commons, and could not be displaced easily. He was further dismayed when the government introduced the India Bill, which proposed to reform the government of India by transferring political power from the East India Company to Parliamentary commissioners.[83] Although George actually favoured greater control over the company, the proposed commissioners were all political allies of Fox.[84] Immediately after the House of Commons passed it, George authorised Lord Temple to inform the House of Lords that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy. The bill was rejected by the Lords; three days later, the Portland ministry was dismissed, and William Pitt the Younger was appointed prime minister, with Temple as his secretary of state. On 17 December 1783, Parliament voted in favour of a motion condemning the influence of the monarch in parliamentary voting as a ""high crime"" and Temple was forced to resign. Temple\'s departure destabilised the government, and three months later the government lost its majority and Parliament was dissolved; the subsequent election gave Pitt a firm mandate.[8]', ""Pitt's appointment was a great victory for George. It proved that the King could appoint prime ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords.[85] During and after Pitt's ministry, George was extremely popular in Britain.[86] The British people admired him for his piety and for remaining faithful to his wife.[87] He was fond of his children and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy, in 1782 and 1783 respectively.[88] Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue.[89] When his children strayed from George's principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.[90]"", ""In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled over the terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most reasonable for the Prince of Wales to act as regent, Fox suggested, to Pitt's consternation, that it was the Prince's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority.[104] In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George recovered.[105]"", 'A brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798.[111] In 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the ""United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"". George used the opportunity to abandon the title ""king of France"", which English and British sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III.[112] It was suggested that George adopt the title ""Emperor of the British Isles"", but he refused.[8] As part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics. George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism.[113] Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign.[114] At about the same time, George had a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question.[115] On 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Addington. Addington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. In October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.[116]', 'In 1804, George\'s recurrent illness returned; after his recovery, Addington resigned and Pitt regained power. Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry, but George refused. Lord Grenville perceived an injustice to Fox, and refused to join the new ministry.[8] Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria, Russia, and Sweden. This Third Coalition, however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805. The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt\'s health, and he died in 1806, reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry. Grenville became prime minister, and his ""Ministry of All the Talents"" included Fox. Grenville pushed through the Slave Trade Act 1807, which passed both houses of Parliament with large majorities.[123] George was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment. After Fox\'s death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. To boost recruitment, the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the armed forces. George instructed them not only to drop the measure, but also to agree never to set up such a measure again. The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future.[124] They were dismissed and replaced by the Duke of Portland, as the nominal prime minister, with actual power being held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Spencer Perceval. Parliament was dissolved, and the subsequent election gave the ministry a strong majority in the House of Commons. George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little real significance.[125]']"

He led an extravagant lifestyle that contributed to the fashions of the Regency era. He was a patron of new forms of leisure, style and taste. He commissioned John Nash to build the Royal Pavilion in Brighton and remodel Buckingham Palace, and commissioned Jeffry Wyatville to rebuild Windsor Castle. George\'s charm and culture earned him the title ""the first gentleman of England"", but his dissolute way of life and poor relationships with his parents and his wife, Caroline of Brunswick, earned him the contempt of the people and dimmed the prestige of the monarchy. He excluded Caroline from his coronation and asked the government to introduce the unpopular Pains and Penalties Bill in an unsuccessful attempt to divorce her.', ""At the age of 18, Prince George was given a separate establishment, and in dramatic contrast to his prosaic, scandal-free father, threw himself with zest into a life of dissipation and wild extravagance involving heavy drinking and numerous mistresses and escapades. He was a witty conversationalist, drunk or sober, and showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace. George turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of £60,000 (equivalent to £9,124,000 today[6]) from Parliament and an annual income of £50,000 (equivalent to £7,603,000 today[6]) from his father. It was far too little for his wants – his stables alone cost £31,000 a year. He then established his residence in Carlton House, where he lived a profligate life.[7] Animosity developed between the prince and his father, who desired more frugal behaviour on the part of the heir apparent. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the prince's adherence to Charles James Fox and other radically inclined politicians.[8]"", ""Prince George was plunged into debt by his exorbitant lifestyle. His father refused to assist him, forcing him to quit Carlton House and live at Fitzherbert's residence. In 1787, the prince's political allies proposed to relieve his debts with a parliamentary grant. George's relationship with Fitzherbert was suspected, and revelation of the illegal marriage would have scandalised the nation and doomed any parliamentary proposal to aid him. Acting on Prince George's authority, the Whig leader Charles James Fox declared that the story was a calumny.[14] Fitzherbert was not pleased with the public denial of the marriage in such vehement terms and contemplated severing her ties to George. He appeased her by asking another Whig, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, to restate Fox's forceful declaration in more careful words. Parliament, meanwhile, granted the prince £161,000 (equivalent to £25,841,000 today[6]) to pay his debts and £60,000 (equivalent to £9,630,000 today[6]) for improvements to Carlton House.[5][15][16]"", 'Although arguably barred from doing so, Parliament began debating a regency. In the House of Commons, Charles James Fox declared his opinion that Prince George was automatically entitled to exercise sovereignty during the King\'s incapacity. A contrasting opinion was held by the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, who argued that, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, the right to choose a regent belonged to Parliament alone.[20] He even stated that, without parliamentary authority ""the Prince of Wales had no more right\xa0... to assume the government, than any other individual subject of the country"".[21] Though disagreeing on the principle underlying a regency, Pitt agreed with Fox that the Prince of Wales would be the most convenient choice for a regent.[14][19]', 'A significant technical impediment to any Regency Bill involved the lack of a speech from the throne, which was necessary before Parliament could proceed to any debates or votes. The speech was normally delivered by the King but could also be delivered by royal representatives known as Lords Commissioners. However, no document could empower the Lords Commissioners to act unless the Great Seal of the Realm was affixed to it. The seal could not be legally affixed without the prior authorisation of the sovereign. Pitt and his fellow ministers ignored the last requirement and instructed the Lord Chancellor to affix the Great Seal without the King\'s consent, as the act of affixing the Great Seal in itself gave legal force to the bill. The legal fiction was denounced by Edmund Burke as ""forgery, fraud"";[24] a ""glaring falsehood""[25] and a ""palpable absurdity"".[25] Prince Frederick described the plan as ""unconstitutional and illegal"".[23] Nevertheless, others in Parliament felt that such a scheme was necessary to preserve an effective government. Consequently, on 3 February 1789, more than two months after it had convened, Parliament was formally opened by an ""illegal"" group of Lords Commissioners. The Regency Bill was introduced, but before it could be passed the King recovered. The King declared retroactively that the instrument authorising the Lords Commissioners to act was valid.[14][19]', ""In late 1810, the King's mental health once again broke down, following the death of his youngest daughter, Princess Amelia. Parliament agreed to follow the precedent of 1788; without the King's consent, the Lord Chancellor affixed the Great Seal of the Realm to letters patent naming Lords Commissioners. The letters patent lacked the Royal Sign Manual, but were sealed by request of resolutions passed by both Houses of Parliament. The Lords Commissioners appointed by the letters patent, in the name of the King, then signified the granting of Royal Assent to a bill that became the Regency Act 1811. Parliament restricted some of the powers of the Prince Regent (as the Prince of Wales became known).

One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned Catholic emancipation, the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, Prince George was expected to support the Whig leader, Lord Grenville. He did not, however, immediately put Grenville and the Whigs into office.

The Prince Regent was prepared to reappoint all the members of the Perceval ministry under a new leader. The House of Commons formally declared its desire for a ""strong and efficient administration"",[44] so George then offered leadership of the government to Lord Wellesley and afterwards to Lord Moira. He doomed the attempts of both to failure, however, by forcing each to construct an all-party ministry at a time when neither party wished to share power with the other. Possibly using the failure of the two peers as a pretext, George immediately reappointed the Perceval administration, with Lord Liverpool as prime minister.[45]', 'During this period George took an active interest in matters of style and taste, and his associates such as the dandy Beau Brummell and the architect John Nash created the Regency style, exemplified by the Regency terraces of Regent\'s Park and Regent Street. George took up the new idea of the seaside spa and had the Brighton Pavilion developed as a fantastical seaside palace, adapted by Nash in the ""Indian Gothic"" style inspired loosely by the Taj Mahal, with extravagant ""Indian"" and ""Chinese"" interiors.[48]', 'By the spring of 1830, George\'s imminent end was apparent. Now largely confined to his bedchambers, having completely lost sight in one eye and describing himself ""as blind as a beetle"", he was forced to approve legislation with a stamp of his signature in the presence of witnesses.[70] His weight was recorded to be 20 stone (130\xa0kg; 280\xa0lb).[71] Attacks of breathlessness due to dropsy forced him to sleep upright in a chair, and doctors frequently tapped his abdomen in order to drain excess fluid.[68] Despite his obvious decline, George was admired for clinging doggedly to life.[72] His will to live and still-prodigious appetite astonished observers; in April 1830, the Duke of Wellington wrote that the King had consumed for breakfast ""a Pidgeon and Beef Steak Pye\xa0... Three parts of a bottle of Mozelle, a Glass of Dry Champagne, two Glasses of Port [and] a Glass of Brandy"", followed by a large dose of laudanum.[70] Writing to Maria Fitzherbert in June, the King\'s doctor, Sir Henry Halford, noted ""His Majesty\'s constitution is a gigantic one, and his elasticity under the most severe pressure exceeds what I have ever witnessed in thirty-eight years\' experience.""[73] Though George had been under Halford\'s care since the time of the Regency, the doctor\'s social ambitions and perceived lack of competence were strongly criticised, with The Lancet labelling Halford\'s bulletins on the King\'s health as ""utterly and entirely destitute of information"", subsequently characterising Halford\'s treatment of George, which involved administering both opium and laudanum as sedatives, as appearing to lack sense or direction.[74]', 'The Regency period saw a shift in fashion that was largely determined by George. After political opponents put a tax on wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair.[83] He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin.[84] His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress as it is known today.[85]', 'During the political crisis caused by Catholic emancipation, the Duke of Wellington said that George was ""the worst man he ever fell in with his whole life, the most selfish, the most false, the most ill-natured, the most entirely without one redeeming quality"".[86] However, his eulogy delivered in the House of Lords called George ""the most accomplished man of his age"" and praised his knowledge and talent.[87] Wellington\'s true feelings were probably somewhere between these two extremes; as he said later, George was ""a magnificent patron of the arts\xa0... the most extraordinary compound of talent, wit, buffoonery, obstinacy, and good feeling—in short a medley of the most opposite qualities, with a great preponderance of good—that I ever saw in any character in my life.""[87]']"

He was baptised at Windsor Castle on 7 July 1865 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Longley.[a]', 'In November 1891, George\'s brother, Albert Victor, became engaged to his second cousin once removed Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, known as ""May"" within the family.[12] Her parents were Francis, Duke of Teck (a member of a morganatic, cadet branch of the House of Württemberg), and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, a male-line granddaughter of George\xa0III and a first cousin of Queen Victoria.[13]', ""George inherited the throne at a politically turbulent time.[52] Lloyd George's People's Budget had been rejected the previous year by the Conservative and Unionist-dominated House of Lords, contrary to the normal convention that the Lords did not veto money bills.[53] Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith had asked the previous king to give an undertaking that he would create sufficient Liberal peers to allow the passage of Liberal legislation. Edward had reluctantly agreed, provided the Lords rejected the budget after two successive general elections. After the January 1910 general election, the Conservative peers allowed the budget, for which the government now had an electoral mandate, to pass without a vote.[54]"", 'Asquith attempted to curtail the power of the Lords through constitutional reforms, which were again blocked by the Upper House. A constitutional conference on the reforms broke down in November 1910 after 21 meetings. Asquith and Lord Crewe, Liberal leader in the Lords, asked George to grant a dissolution, leading to a second general election, and to promise to create sufficient Liberal peers if the Lords blocked the legislation again.[55] If George refused, the Liberal government would otherwise resign, which would have given the appearance that the monarch was taking sides – with ""the peers against the people"" – in party politics.[56] The King\'s two private secretaries, the Liberal Lord Knollys and the Unionist Lord Stamfordham, gave George conflicting advice.[57][58] Knollys advised George to accept the Cabinet\'s demands, while Stamfordham advised George to accept the resignation.[57] Like his father, George reluctantly agreed to the dissolution and creation of peers, although he felt his ministers had taken advantage of his inexperience to browbeat him.[59] After the December 1910 general election, the Lords let the bill pass on hearing of the threat to swamp the house with new peers.[60] The subsequent Parliament Act 1911 permanently removed – with a few exceptions – the power of the Lords to veto bills. George later came to feel that Knollys had withheld information from him about the willingness of the opposition to form a government if the Liberals had resigned.[61]', ""On 17 July 1917, George appeased British nationalist feelings by issuing a royal proclamation that changed the name of the British royal house from the German-sounding House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor.[69] He and all his British relatives relinquished their German titles and styles and adopted British-sounding surnames. George compensated his male relatives by giving them British peerages. His cousin Prince Louis of Battenberg, who earlier in the war had been forced to resign as First Sea Lord through anti-German feeling, became Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, while Queen Mary's brothers became Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge, and Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone.[70]"", 'The First World War took a toll on George\'s health: he was seriously injured on 28 October 1915 when thrown by his horse at a troop review in France,[106] and his heavy smoking exacerbated recurring breathing problems. He suffered from chronic bronchitis. In 1925, on the instruction of his doctors, he was reluctantly sent on a recuperative private cruise in the Mediterranean; it was his third trip abroad since the war, and his last.[107] In November\xa01928, he fell seriously ill with septicaemia, which localised between the base of his right lung and diaphragm in the form of an empyema that required drainage.[108] For the next two years his son Edward took over many of his duties.[109] In 1929, the suggestion of a further rest abroad was rejected by the King ""in rather strong language"".[110] Instead, he retired for three months to Craigweil House, Aldwick, in the seaside resort of Bognor, Sussex.[111] As a result of his stay, the town acquired the suffix Regis – Latin for ""of the King"". A myth later grew that his last words, on being told that he would soon be well enough to revisit the town, were ""Bugger Bognor!""[112][113][114]', 'George never fully recovered. In his final year, he was occasionally administered oxygen.[115] The death of his favourite sister, Victoria, in December 1935 depressed him deeply. On the evening of 15\xa0January 1936, George took to his bedroom at Sandringham House complaining of a cold; he remained in the room until his death.[116] He became gradually weaker, drifting in and out of consciousness. Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin later said:', 'The German composer Paul Hindemith went to a BBC studio on the morning after the King\'s death and in six hours wrote Trauermusik (""Mourning Music""), for viola and orchestra. It was performed that same evening in a live broadcast by the BBC, with Adrian Boult conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the composer as soloist.[126]\nAt the procession to George\'s lying in state in Westminster Hall, the cross surmounting the Imperial State Crown atop George\'s coffin fell off and landed in the gutter as the cortège turned into New Palace Yard. George\'s eldest son and successor, Edward VIII, saw it fall and wondered whether it was a bad omen for his new reign.[127] As a mark of respect to their father, George\'s four surviving sons – Edward, Albert, Henry, and George – mounted the guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes, at the catafalque on the night before the funeral.[128] The vigil was not repeated until the death of George\'s daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. George V was interred at St George\'s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 28 January 1936.[129] Edward abdicated before the year was out, leaving Albert to ascend the throne as George VI.[130]']"

War with the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. George VI was seen as sharing the hardships of the common people and his popularity soared. Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz while the King and Queen were there, and his younger brother the Duke of Kent was killed on active service. George became known as a symbol of British determination to win the war. Britain and its allies were victorious in 1945, but the British Empire declined. Ireland had largely broken away, followed by the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 and instead adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign and died at Sandringham House, aged 56, of a coronary thrombosis. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II.', 'Because of his stutter, Albert dreaded public speaking.[40] After his closing speech at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners,[41] he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently.[42] Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation.[43] With his delivery improved, Albert opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire with the Duchess in 1927.[44] Their journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took them via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.[45]', 'Albert assumed the regnal name ""George VI"" to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy.[55] The beginning of George VI\'s reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as ""His Royal Highness Prince Edward"" for the abdication broadcast,[56] but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession, Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including ""Royal Highness"".[57] In settling the issue, George\'s first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title ""Duke of Windsor"" with the style ""Royal Highness"", but the letters patent creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House, as these were private properties and did not pass to him automatically.[58] Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new queen consort, with the Order of the Garter.[59]', 'The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support British prime minister Neville Chamberlain\'s appeasement of Hitler.[11][64] When the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family.[11] While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain\'s policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian and politician John Grigg to describe George\'s behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as ""the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century"".[65]', ""The trip was intended to soften the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public.[70] The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor was dispelled.[71] They visited the 1939 New York World's Fair and stayed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and at his private estate at Hyde Park, New York.[72] A strong bond of friendship was forged between Roosevelt and the royal couple during the tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.[73][74]"", 'On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, George went to London Airport[e] to see Elizabeth and Philip off on their tour to Australia via Kenya.

With Gloucester\'s death, Anne was the only person in the line of succession to the throne, as established by the ""Glorious Revolution"". To extend the line and secure the Protestant succession, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which designated William and Anne\'s nearest Protestant cousins, the House of Hanover, as the next in line after Anne.[38]', 'Anne obtained a parliamentary allowance of £100,000 a year for George in the event of her death. The bill sped through the House of Commons easily but it was only narrowly passed by the House of Lords. Marlborough supported the bill, but one of the lords against was Marlborough\'s son-in-law, Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland.[46] Marlborough dissuaded her from asking Parliament to make ""her dearly loved husband King Consort"".[47]', 'At the end of 1702, the Occasional Conformity Bill was introduced to Parliament. The bill aimed to disqualify Protestant Dissenters from public office by closing a loophole in the Test Acts, legislation that restricted public office to Anglican conformists. The existing law permitted nonconformists to take office if they took Anglican communion once a year. Anne was in favour of the measure, and forced George to vote for the bill in the House of Lords, even though, being a practising Lutheran, he was an occasional conformist himself.[51] As he cast his vote, he reportedly told an opponent of the bill, ""My heart is vid you""  [sic].[52] The bill did not gather sufficient parliamentary support and was eventually dropped.[51] The following year, the bill was revived, but Anne withheld support, fearing its reintroduction was a deliberate pretence to cause a quarrel between the two main political groups: the Tories (who supported the bill) and the Whigs (who opposed it). Once again it failed.[53] George never became a member of the Church of England, which was headed by his wife throughout her reign. He remained Lutheran even after her accession, and had his own personal chapel.[5]', ""In the first years of Anne's reign, the Whigs gained more power and influence at the expense of the Tories. In his capacity as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, George held influence in parliamentary boroughs on the south coast of England, which he used to support Whig candidates in the general election of 1705.[6] In that year's election for Speaker of the House of Commons, George and Anne supported a Whig candidate, John Smith. George instructed his secretary, George Clarke, who was a Member of Parliament, to vote for Smith, but Clarke refused, instead supporting the Tory candidate William Bromley. Clarke was sacked, and Smith was elected.[54]""]"

The last members of the unit left Wewak on 10 November.[10]"", ""On 25 June 1950, the Korean People's Army (KPA) crossed the border from North Korea into South Korea and advanced towards the capital Seoul, which fell in less than a week. The KPA continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later, the United States offered its assistance to South Korea. In response, the United Nations Security Council requested United Nations (UN) member states to assist in repelling the North Korean attack. Australia initially committed North American P-51 Mustang fighter-bombers from No. 77 Squadron RAAF and infantry from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), both of which were stationed in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF).[27] When the war broke out, 3 RAR was understaffed, underequipped and unprepared for combat as a unit. Immediate action was taken to bring it up to strength with reinforcements and new equipment from Australia, along with an intense training program.[28]"", ""When the Australian government committed 3 RAR, Army Headquarters determined that it would be led by an officer who had served in World War II and had a distinguished record.[1] The commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel F. S. Walsh, who had been in command of the battalion for a year,[29] was to be replaced. Still attending Staff College, Green was chosen. He left Australia for Japan on 8 September,[1] and took over command of 3 RAR on 12 September. He oversaw another two weeks of unit training in Japan, then flew to South Korea on 25 September to await the battalion's arrival.[30] 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September. By that time, the KPA was retreating back into North Korea following the Inchon landings and Pusan Perimeter Offensive.[31] Green's battalion joined Brigadier Basil Coad's 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, part of the force under the Commander-in-Chief United Nations Command,  General of the Army Douglas MacArthur.[32] On 5 October, the entire brigade was airlifted by the United States Air Force (USAF) from Taegu to Kimpo Air Base outside Seoul, their vehicles driving the intervening 420\xa0km (260\xa0mi) and only arriving in Seoul on 9 October. The brigade then moved north under the operational control of the US 1st Cavalry Division.[33]"", 'Green was initially buried in the Christian churchyard at Pakchon on the day he died,[70][71] but his body was soon exhumed and buried in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery (UNMC) in Pusan.[72] He was posthumously awarded the US Silver Star in June 1951.[1][73] According to Barter, Green\'s career as a battalion commander in New Guinea and Korea had been ""exemplary"",[1] and serving Australian soldiers were still inspired by it at the time she wrote his entry in 1996. A commemorative cairn was erected at the barracks of the 41st Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, in Lismore, New South Wales, and as of 1996, a United Nations emblem was affixed to the gates of the Swan Creek farm where he grew up.[1]']"

In 1929, he went to Nicaragua as part of an expedition to conduct a survey for the Inter-Oceanic Nicaragua Canal. Following the 1931 Nicaraguan earthquake, Groves took over Managua\'s water supply system, for which he was awarded the Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit. He attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1935 and 1936, and the Army War College in 1938 and 1939, after which he was posted to the War Department General Staff. Groves developed ""a reputation as a doer, a driver, and a stickler for duty"".[1] In 1940 he became special assistant for construction to the Quartermaster General, tasked with inspecting construction sites and checking on their progress.

The family relocated to there from Vancouver, then moved to Fort Hancock, New Jersey, and returned to Vancouver in 1905. Chaplain Groves was hospitalized with tuberculosis at Fort Bayard in 1905. He decided to settle in southern California and bought a house in Altadena. His next posting was to Fort Apache, Arizona. The family spent their summers there and returned to Altadena where the children attended school.[6]', 'Groves entered Queen Anne High School in 1913, and graduated in 1914.

Bell from California\'s 9th congressional district nominated Groves as an alternate, but the principal nominee accepted. Instead, Groves enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and planned to re-take the West Point entrance exam.

Groves finished fourth in his class, which earned him a commission as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, the first choice of most high ranking cadets.[10][11]"", 'Although Reybold was satisfied with the progress being made, Vannevar Bush was less so. He felt that aggressive leadership was required, and suggested the appointment of a prestigious officer as overall project director.

In order to avoid briefing the Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau Jr., on the project, a special account not subject to the usual auditing and controls was used to hold Trust monies.

He accomplished his task with such outstanding success that in an amazingly short time the Manhattan Engineer District solved this problem of staggering complexity, defeating the Axis powers in the race to produce an instrument whose peacetime potentialities are no less marvellous than its wartime application is awesome. The achievement of General Groves is of unfathomable importance to the future of the nation and the world.[52]', 'The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, met with Groves on 30 January 1948 to evaluate his performance. Eisenhower recounted a long list of complaints about Groves pertaining to his rudeness, arrogance, insensitivity, contempt for the rules, and maneuvering for promotion out of turn. Eisenhower made it clear that Groves would never become Chief of Engineers.[55]']"

The first coins of his reign were struck with him still bearing the title of walī ʿahd al-muslimīn.[38][39] Whether Abd al-Majid had had designs on the caliphate or not, the lack of a direct heir meant that the continuation of the Fatimid dynasty and the Isma\'ili imamate required that he succeed as imam and caliph, since according to Isma\'ili doctrine, ""God does not leave the Moslem Community without an Imam to lead them on the right path"".[40] This was done in a decree (sijill) on 23 January 1132, whereby Abd al-Majid assumed the title al-Ḥāfiz li-Dīn Allāh (\'Keeper of God\'s Religion\').[37][39] For the first time in the Fatimid dynasty, power was not passed from father to son, creating a radical departure from established practice that had to be addressed and justified.

No reference to any son of al-Amir was made. Al-Hafiz claimed that he had—secretly—received the designation (naṣṣ) as successor by al-Amir, and that Caliph al-Mustansir had foreseen this event, and had called al-Hafiz\'s father as walī ʿahd al-muslimīn. Earlier examples of breaks in the direct succession of the imamate, chiefly the designation by Muhammad of his son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib, were brought up to buttress his claim.[38][41][42][43]']"

With a career total of 14.5 victories, he is one of seven American pilots to have achieved ace status in two different wars.', 'Born in Cedar Falls, Iowa, Hagerstrom became eager to fly at a young age. He left college in 1941 to join the USAAF, and participated in the New Guinea campaign of the South West Pacific theater of World War\xa0II. There, he mainly escorted bombers, flying P-40 Warhawks with the 8th Fighter Squadron. He shot down six Japanese aircraft during the war, including four in one morning. After the war, he continued flying, joining the Texas Air National Guard and participating in several air races. By 1950 he was in command of the 111th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, which was deployed to Korea following the outbreak of the Korean War. He later transferred to the USAF and flew F-86 Sabre fighter jets with the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing in ""MiG Alley"", the nickname given to the area around the northern border of North Korea with China. During his service in Korea, he was credited with shooting down 8.5 Chinese, Soviet, and North Korean MiG-15s (the half coming from a shared credit).', 'Like many other aces, Hagerstrom had an aggressive attitude toward his missions. In his book Officers in Flight Suits, historian John Darrell Sherwood calls this a ""flight suit attitude"", which he defines as ""a sense of self-confidence and pride that verged on arrogance"" where ""status was based upon flying ability, not degrees, rank, or \'officer\' skills"".[55] He believes this is why Hagerstrom frequently butted heads with military bureaucrats and never became a general himself.[6] Determined to be at full mental capacity during missions, he never drank, unlike most other pilots, some of whom flew while hungover or left Korea as alcoholics.[56] He was critical of pilots who wanted to just complete their requisite 100 missions and avoid conflict and danger; he was twice abandoned by his wingman during a fight.[57] Hagerstrom enjoyed the adrenaline rush of combat[58] and would put himself at more risk in an effort to shoot down more planes. He would fly into Chinese airspace despite it being forbidden by United Nations Command, and on one mission he buzzed Antung Airfield by flying near the speed of sound at an altitude of 15 feet (4.6\xa0m) in an attempt to draw the MiGs into the air because U.S. pilots were not allowed to attack planes on the ground in China.[59]', 'First Lieutenant (Air Corps) James P.

First Lieutenant Hagerstrom, leading a flight of four fighters on a bomber escort mission, encountered ten to fifteen enemy aircraft and promptly led in the attack. He shot down one enemy airplane, and then attacked two others, scoring damaging hits. Pulling up, he quickly shot down another enemy fighter. Two of the enemy then attacked from a climbing head-on position, and he scored damaging hits on both. Making a close pass at another enemy fighter, he caused it to burst into flames. At this point, he observed four enemy airplanes making a concentrated attack upon two of our fighters. Without hesitation he entered the fight, and succeeded in shooting down one enemy airplane and breaking the enemy formation.

In 1998, Hamasaki released her debut single ""Poker Face""[fn 1] and debut major-label album A Song for ××. The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for five weeks, selling over a million copies.[fn 1] This rapid rise to fame is typically attributed to her insightful style of lyric-writing in contrast to her young age; this would continue to be a defining aspect of her work, listeners praising her poetic way of conveying relatable subjects.[6] Her next ten albums shipped over a million copies in Japan, with her third, Duty, selling nearly three million. A Best, her first compilation album, further established her position as a crowning artist with more than four million copies sold in Japan.[7][8] It was at this time that she represented more than 40% of her record label\'s income.[9]', 'Born in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Hamasaki was raised as an only child by her mother and grandmother; her father had left the family when she was three, and had no further contact with the family.[19][20] Hamasaki was primarily taken care of by her grandmother due to her mother working full-time.[19] She described herself as a ""tomboy"" when she was a teenager, and as a ""strange kid"" who ""liked to be alone"".[21]', 'In 2002, I Am... marked several milestones for Hamasaki. Hamasaki increased her control over her music by composing all of the songs on the album under the pseudonym ""Crea"", of which the 2000 single ""M"" was the first. ""Connected"" (November 2002) and ""A Song Is Born"" (December 2001) were the exceptions.[40] I Am... also showed evolution in Hamasaki\'s lyrical style: it was a retreat from the themes of ""loneliness and confusion"" of some of her earlier songs.[41] Moved by the September 11 attacks, Hamasaki revised her vision of I Am..., focusing on issues such as faith and world peace. ""A Song Is Born"", in particular, was directly influenced by the events.[41][42] The single, a duet with Keiko Yamada, was released as part of Avex\'s non-profit Song Nation project, which raised money for charity.[43][44][fn 3] She also dropped the planned cover and opted instead to be portrayed as a ""peace muse"", explaining,', 'In 2003, Hamasaki released three singles, ""&"", ""Forgiveness"", and ""No Way to Say"". To celebrate the release of her thirtieth single (""Forgiveness""), Hamasaki held the A Museum concert at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium.[55] Her mini-album Memorial Address (December 2003) was her first album to be released in CD+DVD format in addition to the regular CD-only format, a decision that came from her increased interest in the direction of her music videos.[56] Like her previous albums, Memorial Address topped the Oricon chart and sold over a million copies.[57][58] Sales of Hamasaki\'s singles began to wane. Although all three of the album\'s singles topped the Oricon charts, ""&"" was Hamasaki\'s last single to sell over 500,000 copies.[59] By the end of her Arena Tour 2003–2004, Hamasaki had grown dissatisfied with her position in Avex: she felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person.[60] Along with her dissatisfaction over her last two studio albums (which she thought had been rushed), this led her to begin work on My Story (December 2004) early. In contrast with her previous albums, My Story had no set theme, nor did Hamasaki attempt to write ""something good"" or even ""something that would give people hope""; rather, she simply wrote freely and honestly.[60][fn 7] As a result, the album contained mostly autobiographical lyrics about her emotions and reminiscences of her career. She approached the composition of the music with the same freedom as the lyrics, with the album\'s notable rock overtones expressing her liking for rock music.[61] She was so pleased with the result that she declared My Story the first album she felt satisfied with.[61] My Story and its singles, ""Moments"", ""Inspire"", and ""Carols"", all topped the weekly Oricon charts; moreover, with sales of over 1,100,000 units, My Story became Hamasaki\'s last million-selling studio album according to Oricon.[fn 8][62][63] From January to April 2005, Hamasaki held the nationwide My Story arena tour, her first album-based tour.[60] Also in January, she began working with Lamoureux Orchestra to create My Story Classical, a classical version of My Story; the album served as an ""alter-ego"" of the mostly aggressive My Story. The orchestra also created a classical version of ""A Song Is Born"", which was included on My Story Classical and which Hamasaki performed at the opening of the Expo 2005.[64]', 'As Hamasaki matured, her lyrics began to express more confidence; themes in her later albums included love and the struggles of women.[54][66][74] With Guilty, Hamasaki began to compose her lyrics not only as an exposition of her personal feelings but as encouragements for her listeners, an outlook she applied in Next Level as well. In songs such as ""Talkin\' 2 Myself"" and ""Mirrorcle World"", Hamasaki deals with the ""awareness and fighting spirit of surviving in a high-risk age"" to encourage listeners. In addition to personal experiences and feelings, Hamasaki bases lyrics on sources such as historical events. The life of Joan of Arc was the inspiration for ""Free & Easy"", a story told to her by her friend about a saint named Mary served as the basis for ""M"", and the September 11 attacks inspired ""A Song Is Born"".[229]']"

Born into a Malay aristocratic family in the Sultanate of Langkat in North Sumatra, he was educated in both Sumatra and Java. While attending senior high school in Surakarta around 1930, Amir became involved with the nationalist movement and fell in love with a Javanese schoolmate, Ilik Sundari. Even after Amir continued his studies in legal school in Batavia (now Jakarta) the two remained close, only separating in 1937 when Amir was recalled to Sumatra to marry the sultan's daughter and take on responsibilities of the court. Though unhappy with his marriage, he fulfilled his courtly duties. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence in 1945, he served as the government's representative in Langkat. The following year he was killed in a social revolution led by the PESINDO (Pemuda Sosialis Indonesia), and buried in a mass grave."", 'Amir was schooled in Islamic principles such as Qu\'ran reading, fiqh, and tawhid, and studied at the Azizi Mosque in Tanjung Pura from a young age.[3] He remained a devout Muslim throughout his life.

Several sources, including the Indonesian government\'s Language Centre, state that he started school in 1916,[4] while the biographer M. Lah Husny puts the future poet\'s first year of formal schooling as 1918.[5] At the Dutch-language elementary school where Amir first studied, he began writing[6] and received good marks;[7] in her biography of him, Nh.

In June 1963, Hancock undertook a mission to Britain, France and the United States to consider potential replacements for the English Electric Canberra bomber as Australia\'s prime aerial strike platform. After investigating the US ""TFX"", North American A-5 Vigilante and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, the British BAC TSR-2, and the French Dassault Mirage IV, Hancock decided the swing-wing TFX, forerunner of the General Dynamics F-111, would be the aircraft best suited for this role. As the TFX had not yet flown, he recommended purchase of the already operational Vigilante to counteract a perceived imminent threat from Indonesia. In the event, the Federal Government did not go ahead with an immediate replacement for the Canberra, and Hancock\'s original choice of the TFX was taken up as a long-term solution, leading to Australia\'s agreement in October to purchase the F-111C.[58] The same month, as Konfrontasi continued to simmer, Hancock approved simplification to the rules of engagement for Australian CAC Sabre fighters based at RAAF Butterworth to engage and destroy Indonesian aircraft violating Malay air space.[59] The following month he urged using RAAF Canberras from Butterworth to make pre-emptive strikes against Indonesian air bases, in retaliation for incursions into West Malaysia, but Britain, which had initially requested Australia\'s involvement, held back on action.[60]', 'Once the F-111 had been ordered, Hancock sought a suitable forward airfield from which they could operate. In this, he continued a policy initiated by his predecessor as CAS, Air Marshal Scherger, of developing a chain of so-called ""bare bases"" in Northern Australia. Hancock recommended redeveloping RAAF Base Learmonth in the northern part of Western Australia, due to its proximity to Indonesia. Flying out of this airfield, the F-111s could destroy ""vital centres in Java""; just as importantly for deterrence purposes, Hancock contended, enhancing the base\'s capability would send a clear message to Indonesia\'s hierarchy. Though the project was delayed, in part due to thawing in relations between Australia and Indonesia, Learmonth\'s upgrade was completed in 1973, the same year the F-111 finally entered RAAF service.[61][62] The latter part of Hancock\'s tour as CAS coincided with the beginning of large-scale Australian involvement in the Vietnam War. By mid-1964, the Commonwealth had already sent a small team of military advisors, plus a detachment of newly acquired DHC-4 Caribou cargo planes, to the region at the request of the South Vietnamese government.[7][63] Under Hancock, the Caribou had itself only been reluctantly ordered by the Air Force following intense pressure from the Army and the Federal government for a STOL transport.[64] Concerned at the potential drain on the RAAF\'s resources, Hancock tried to resist calls for commitments to Vietnam. His negative views were in contrast to the hawkish attitudes of his deputy, Air Vice-Marshal Colin Hannah, and Air Chief Marshal Scherger, now Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Australia\'s senior soldier.[7][65] In April 1965, as part of American operations in Indochina, United States Air Force strike aircraft took up residence at Ubon Air Force Base, Thailand, which since 1962 had been home to No.\xa079 Squadron Sabres and run by the RAAF under SEATO arrangements. Hancock proposed that Australia continue to command the facility and provide local air defence, though this effectively made the Sabres a support unit in the war effort and therefore potential targets of North Vietnamese attack; as it happened, none occurred.[66]']"

The profession suited his detached and open-minded temperament, and his decisions soon won him a reputation for craftsmanship and authority. Between 1909 and 1914, under the influence of Herbert Croly's social theories, Hand supported New Nationalism. He ran unsuccessfully as the Progressive Party's candidate for chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1913, but withdrew from active politics shortly afterwards. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge elevated Hand to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which he went on to lead as the senior circuit judge (later retitled chief judge) from 1939 until his semi-retirement in 1951.

Instead, he became a member of the Perry Light Infantry, a regiment of National Guard troops consisting mostly of young Cleveland businessmen.  In 1864, his regiment was briefly mustered into active service as the 150th Ohio Infantry and sent to be garrison troops at Fort Stevens, part of Washington, D.C.'s defenses.  During the time the Perry Light Infantry was in service, it saw brief combat action as Confederate General Jubal Early feigned an attack on Washington.  However, Hanna, who had been commissioned a second lieutenant, was absent during that time, having been sent to escort the body of a deceased soldier back to Ohio.  The regiment was mustered out in August 1864.[13]  After the war, Hanna was elected a companion of the Ohio Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States—a military society of officers of the Union armed forces and their descendants."", ""During Grant's first four-year term, Hanna began to involve himself in politics.  At first, his interest was purely local, supporting Republican candidates for municipal and Cuyahoga County offices.[22]  In 1869, he was elected to the Cleveland Board of Education, but as he was traveling a good deal for business at the time, was able to attend less than half the meetings.[23]  In 1873, disgusted by local scandals and the influence of party bosses, he and other Republicans briefly abandoned the party to elect a Democrat running for mayor of Cleveland on a reform agenda.[22]"", 'Through the months leading up to the Republican convention in June in St. Louis, Hanna built his organization, paying for expenses, and applying the techniques of business to politics.  Hanna met with many politicians at his Cleveland home.  He paid for thousands of copies of McKinley\'s speeches to be printed and shipped quantities of McKinley posters, badges, and buttons across the nation.  New Hampshire Senator William E. Chandler commented, ""If Mr. Hanna has covered every district in the United States, in the same manner, he did those in Alabama, McKinley will be nominated.""[65][66]', 'A major issue, going into the 1896 election cycle, was the question of the currency.  The United States, since 1873, had effectively been on the gold standard—the metal, if presented to the government, would be assayed and struck into coin for a slight charge to cover expenses.  Silver, in contrast, though widely mined, could not be presented for conversion into coin, but had to be sold as a commodity.  The gold standard was unpopular in many agricultural and mining areas, as the quantity of gold available limited the money supply, making it difficult for farmers to obtain loans and pay debts.  Advocates of the free and unlimited coinage of silver believed that doing so would cure the country\'s economic malaise by increasing the money supply.  Advocates of the gold standard argued that a ""free silver"" policy (sometimes called ""bimetallism"") would inflate the currency, and lead to difficulties in international trade with nations on the gold standard.[72][73]  At the time, the precious metal in a silver dollar was worth about $0.53, and under such proposals, silver worth that much would be returned to depositors as a one-dollar coin, ""free""—that is, without a charge for the Mint\'s costs for assaying and coining.[74]', 'Despite the initial popularity of Bryan\'s message, Hanna was convinced the Democrat\'s support would recede. ""He\'s talking Silver all the time, and that\'s where we\'ve got him"", Hanna stated, pounding his desk, in July.[86]  He proved correct; the silver enthusiasm waned by September and Bryan had no ready replacement for it.  McKinley, on the other hand, convinced that his ""sound money"" campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, ""I do not know what you think about it, but I believe it is a good deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world.""[87]', ""Given Hanna's determination to win and his willingness to play by the rules as they existed, money may have changed hands during the campaign, but if it did, it is important to remember the context.  If Hanna engaged in such behavior, that was the way the game was played on both sides\xa0... Hanna, of course, was not without resources.  It is helpful, for example, when you are good friends with the president of the United States, a man also personally very influential in Ohio politics.[110]"", 'Even during the second Cleveland administration, Americans took keen interest in the ongoing revolt in Cuba, then a Spanish colony.  Most Americans believed that Cuba should be independent and that Spain should leave the Western Hemisphere.  Beginning in 1895, Congress passed a number of resolutions calling for Cuban independence.  Although Cleveland pursued a policy of neutrality, his Secretary of State, Richard Olney, warned Spain that the patience of the United States was not inexhaustible.  Sherman, then a senator, favored neutrality but believed that the US would inevitably go to war over Cuba.[123]  Soon after Hanna was appointed to the Senate, McKinley called Congress into special session to consider tariff legislation.  Despite the stated purpose of the session, a number of resolutions were introduced calling for independence for Cuba, by force if necessary.  When the press asked Hanna if he felt there would be action on Cuba during the session, he responded: ""I don\'t know.  You can\'t tell about that.  A spark might drop in there at any time and precipitate action.""[124]', 'Senator Hanna, fresh from the bargain for a seat in the United States Senate, probably felt the need of recouping his Ohio expenses as well as helping his financial friends out of the hole when he began playing American patriotism against Wall Street money\xa0... Hanna said there would be no war.  He spoke as one having authority.  His edict meant that Uncle Sam might be kicked and cuffed from one continent to another.[132]', 'The Navy\'s report blamed an external cause, believed by many to be a Spanish mine or bomb, for the sinking of Maine (modern reports have suggested an internal explosion within a coal bunker).  Despite the increased calls for war, McKinley hoped to preserve peace.  However, when it became clear that the United States would accept nothing but Cuban independence, which the Spanish were not prepared to grant, negotiations broke off.  On April 11, McKinley asked Congress for authority to secure Cuban independence, using force if necessary.[135]  Hanna supported McKinley in obtaining that authority, though he stated privately, ""If Congress had started this, I\'d break my neck to stop it.""[136]  Spain broke off diplomatic relations on April 20; Congress declared war five days later, retroactive to April 21.[137]', ""Hanna spent much of his time based at the campaign's New York office, while renting a seaside cottage in Elberon, New Jersey.[152]  In September, a strike by the United Mine Workers threatened a crisis which might cause problems for McKinley.  Hanna believed that the miners' grievances were just, and he persuaded the parties to allow him to arbitrate.  With Hanna's aid, the two sides arrived at a negotiated settlement.[153]"", ""The US entered into negotiations with Colombia for rights to build a canal; a treaty was signed but was rejected by the Colombian Senate.  In November 1903, Panama, with the support of the United States, broke away from Colombia, and Bunau-Varilla, the representative of the new government in Washington, signed a treaty granting the US a zone in which to build a canal.[160]  The United States Senate was called upon to ratify the treaty in February 1904; the debate began as Hanna lay dying.  The treaty was ratified on February 23, 1904, eight days after Hanna's death.[161]"", 'On January 30, 1904, Hanna attended the Gridiron Club dinner at the Arlington Hotel.  He neither ate nor drank, and when asked how his health was, responded ""Not good.""[167]  He never again left his Washington residence,[167] having fallen ill with typhoid fever.[168]  As the days passed, politicians began to wait in the Arlington lobby, close to Hanna\'s house, for news; a letter from the President, ""May you soon be with us, old fellow, as strong in body and as vigorous in your leadership as ever"" was never read by the recipient.[169]  Hanna drifted in and out of consciousness for several days; on the morning of February 15, his heart began to fail.  Roosevelt visited at 3\xa0pm, unseen by the dying man.  At 6:30\xa0pm, Senator Hanna died, and the crowd of congressional colleagues, government officials, and diplomats who had gathered in the lobby of the Arlington left the hotel, many sobbing.  Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris noted Hanna\'s achievement in industry and in politics, ""He had not done badly in either field; he had made seven million dollars, and a President of the United States.""[169]']"

Harding released political prisoners who had been arrested for their opposition to World War I. In 1923, Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco while on a western tour, and was succeeded by Vice President Calvin Coolidge."", ""Upon graduating, Harding had stints as a teacher and as an insurance man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 (equivalent to $9,800 in 2023) in partnership with others to purchase a failing newspaper, The Marion Star, the weakest of the growing city's three papers and its only daily. The 18-year-old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the 1884 Republican National Convention, where he hobnobbed with better-known journalists and supported the presidential nominee, former Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Harding returned from Chicago to find that the sheriff had reclaimed the paper.[14] During the election campaign, Harding worked for the Marion Democratic Mirror and was annoyed at having to praise the Democratic presidential nominee, New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the election.[15] Afterward, with his father's financial help, Harding gained ownership of the paper.[14]"", 'The population of Marion grew from 4,000 in 1880 to twice that in 1890, and to 12,000 by 1900. This growth helped the Star, and Harding did his best to promote the city, purchasing stock in many local enterprises. A few of these turned out badly, but he was generally successful as an investor, leaving an estate of $850,000 in 1923 (equivalent to $15.2\xa0million in 2023).[17] According to Harding biographer John Dean, Harding\'s ""civic influence was that of an activist who used his editorial page to effectively keep his nose—and a prodding voice—in all the town\'s public business"".[18] To date, Harding is the only U.S. president to have had full-time journalism experience.[14] He became an ardent supporter of Governor Joseph B. Foraker, a Republican.[19]', 'Harding began his four years as a state senator as a political unknown; he ended them as one of the most popular figures in the Ohio Republican Party. He always appeared calm and displayed humility, characteristics that endeared him to fellow Republicans even as he passed them in his political rise. Legislative leaders consulted him on difficult problems.[35] It was usual at that time for state senators in Ohio to serve only one term, but Harding gained renomination in 1901. After the assassination of McKinley in September (he was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt), much of the appetite for politics was temporarily lost in Ohio. In November, Harding won a second term, more than doubling his margin of victory to 3,563 votes.[36]', ""In early 1903, Harding announced he would run for Governor of Ohio, prompted by the withdrawal of the leading candidate, Congressman Charles W. F. Dick. Hanna and George Cox felt that Harding was not electable due to his work with Foraker—as the Progressive Era commenced, the public was starting to take a dimmer view of the trading of political favors and of bosses such as Cox. Accordingly, they persuaded Cleveland banker Myron T. Herrick, a friend of McKinley's, to run. Herrick was also better-placed to take votes away from the likely Democratic candidate, reforming Cleveland Mayor Tom L. Johnson. With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination, Harding sought nomination as lieutenant governor, and both Herrick and Harding were nominated by acclamation.[39] Foraker and Hanna (who died of typhoid fever in February 1904) both campaigned for what was dubbed the Four-H ticket. Herrick and Harding won by overwhelming margins.[40]"", 'Once he and Harding were inaugurated, Herrick made ill-advised decisions that turned crucial Republican constituencies against him, alienating farmers by opposing the establishment of an agricultural college.[40] On the other hand, according to Sinclair, ""Harding had little to do, and he did it very well"".[41] His responsibility to preside over the state Senate allowed him to increase his growing network of political contacts.[41] Harding and others envisioned a successful gubernatorial run in 1905, but Herrick refused to stand aside. In early 1905, Harding announced he would accept nomination as governor if offered, but faced with the anger of leaders such as Cox, Foraker and Dick (Hanna\'s replacement in the Senate), announced he would seek no office in 1905. Herrick was defeated, but his new running mate, Andrew L. Harris, was elected, and succeeded as governor after five months in office on the death of Democrat John M. Pattison. One Republican official wrote to Harding, ""Aren\'t you sorry Dick wouldn\'t let you run for Lieutenant Governor?""[42]', ""The party split grew, and in 1912, Taft and Roosevelt were rivals for the Republican nomination. The 1912 Republican National Convention was bitterly divided. At Taft's request, Harding gave a speech nominating the president, but the angry delegates were not receptive to Harding's oratory. Taft was renominated, but Roosevelt supporters bolted the party. Harding, as a loyal Republican, supported Taft. The Republican vote was split between Taft, the party's official candidate, and Roosevelt, running under the label of the Progressive Party. This allowed the Democratic candidate, New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, to be elected.[49]"", 'With most Progressives having rejoined the Republican Party, their former leader, Theodore Roosevelt, was deemed likely to make a third run for the White House in 1920, and was the overwhelming favorite for the Republican nomination. These plans ended when Roosevelt suddenly died on January 6, 1919. A number of candidates quickly emerged, including General Leonard Wood, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden, California Senator Hiram Johnson, and a host of relatively minor possibilities such as Herbert Hoover (renowned for his World War I relief work), Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, and General John J. Pershing.[70]', 'The night of June 11–12, 1920 would become famous in political history as the night of the ""smoke-filled room"", in which, legend has it, party elders agreed to force the convention to nominate Harding. Historians have focused on the session held in the suite of Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Will Hays at the Blackstone Hotel, at which senators and others came and went, and numerous possible candidates were discussed. Utah Senator Reed Smoot, before his departure early in the evening, backed Harding, telling Hays and the others that as the Democrats were likely to nominate Governor Cox, they should pick Harding to win Ohio. Smoot also told The New York Times that there had been an agreement to nominate Harding, but that it would not be done for several ballots yet.[88] This was not true: a number of participants backed Harding (others supported his rivals), but there was no pact to nominate him, and the senators had little power to enforce any agreement. Two other participants in the smoke-filled room discussions, Kansas Senator Charles Curtis and Colonel George Brinton McClellan Harvey, a close friend of Hays, predicted to the press that Harding would be nominated because of the liabilities of the other candidates.[89]', 'The reassembled delegates had heard rumors that Harding was the choice of a cabal of senators. Although this was not true, delegates believed it, and sought a way out by voting for Harding. When balloting resumed on the morning of June 12, Harding gained votes on each of the next four ballots, rising to 1331⁄2 as the two front runners saw little change. Lodge then declared a three-hour recess, to the outrage of Daugherty, who raced to the podium, and confronted him, ""You cannot defeat this man this way! The motion was not carried! You cannot defeat this man!""[91] Lodge and others used the break to try to stop the Harding momentum and make RNC Chairman Hays the nominee, a scheme Hays refused to have anything to do with.[92] The ninth ballot, after some initial suspense, saw delegation after delegation break for Harding, who took the lead with 3741⁄2 votes to 249 for Wood and 1211⁄2 for Lowden (Johnson had 83). Lowden released his delegates to Harding, and the tenth ballot, held at 6\xa0p.m., was a mere formality, with Harding finishing with 6721⁄5 votes to 156 for Wood. The nomination was made unanimous. The delegates, desperate to leave town before they incurred more hotel expenses, then proceeded to the vice presidential nomination. Harding wanted Senator Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin, who was unwilling to run, but before Lenroot\'s name could be withdrawn and another candidate decided on, an Oregon delegate proposed Governor Coolidge, which was met with a roar of approval from the delegates. Coolidge, popular for his role in breaking the Boston police strike of 1919, was nominated for vice president, receiving two and a fraction votes more than Harding had. James Morgan wrote in The Boston Globe: ""The delegates would not listen to remaining in Chicago over Sunday\xa0... the President makers did not have a clean shirt. On such things, Rollo, turns the destiny of nations.""[93][94]', ""The Democratic National Convention opened in San Francisco on June 28, 1920, under a shadow cast by Woodrow Wilson, who wished to be nominated for a third term. Delegates were convinced Wilson's health would not permit him to serve, and looked elsewhere for a candidate. Former Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo was a major contender, but he was Wilson's son-in-law, and refused to consider a nomination so long as the president wanted it. Many at the convention voted for McAdoo anyway, and a deadlock ensued with Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. On the 44th\xa0ballot, the Democrats nominated Governor Cox for president, with his running mate Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. As Cox was, when not in politics, a newspaper owner and editor, this placed two Ohio editors against each other for the presidency, and some complained there was no real political choice. Both Cox and Harding were economic conservatives, and were reluctant progressives at best.[97]"", 'On July 26, 1923, Harding toured Vancouver, British Columbia as the first sitting American president to visit Canada. He was welcomed by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia Walter Nichol,[188] Premier of British Columbia John Oliver, and the Mayor of Vancouver, and spoke to a crowd of over 50,000. Two years after his death, a memorial to Harding was unveiled in Stanley Park.[189] Harding visited a golf course, but completed only six holes before becoming fatigued. After resting for an hour, he played the 17th and 18th holes so it would appear he had completed the round. He did not succeed in hiding his exhaustion; one reporter thought he looked so tired that a rest of mere days would be insufficient to refresh him.[190]']"

He was a member of the Harrison family of Virginia—a grandson of the ninth president, William Henry Harrison, and a great-grandson of Benjamin Harrison\xa0V, a Founding Father.', 'When United States Senator Morton died in 1877, the Republicans nominated Harrison to run for the seat, but the party failed to gain a majority in the state legislature, which at that time elected senators; the Democratic majority elected Daniel W. Voorhees instead.[71][c] In 1879, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Harrison to the Mississippi River Commission, which worked to develop internal improvements on the river.[72] As a delegate to the 1880 Republican National Convention the following year,[73] he was instrumental in breaking a deadlock on candidates, and James A. Garfield won the nomination.', 'Harrison placed fifth on the first ballot, with Senator Sherman in the lead, and the next few ballots showed little change.[91] As the convention moved forward, Harrison became ""everyone\'s second choice in a field of seven candidates.""[81] Then, after Sherman ""faltered in the balloting,""[81] Harrison gained support.

Thurman from Ohio; Vice President Hendricks had died in office on November 25, 1885.[81] After returning to America, Blaine visited Harrison at his home in October.[93]', ""Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich framed the McKinley Tariff that would raise the tariff even higher, including making some rates intentionally prohibitive.[127] At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add reciprocity provisions, which would allow the president to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports.[125] The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production.[127] Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to the reputation of the Billion-Dollar Congress.[125]"", 'That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the president shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof.[142]', ""In response to the massacre, Harrison directed Major-General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3,500 U.S. troops to be deployed to South Dakota, which suppressed the Ghost Dance movement.[145] The massacre has been widely considered as the last major engagement of the American Indian Wars.[146] Harrison's general policy on Native Americans in the United States was to encourage their assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful.[148] This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to Native Americans as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.[149]"", ""During Harrison's time in office, the United States was continuing to experience advances in science and technology. A recording of his voice is the earliest extant recording of a president while he was in office. That thirty-six-second recordingⓘ was originally made on a wax phonograph cylinder in 1889 by Gianni Bettini.[150] Harrison also had electricity installed in the White House for the first time by Edison General Electric Company, but he and his wife would not touch the light switches for fear of electrocution and would often go to sleep with the lights on.[151]"", 'Over the course of his administration, Harrison marshaled the country\'s technology to clothe the nation with a credible naval power. When he took office there were only two commissioned warships in the Navy. In his inaugural address he said, ""construction of a sufficient number of warships and their necessary armaments should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care and perfection.""[152] Harrison\'s Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy spearheaded the rapid construction of vessels, and within a year congressional approval was obtained for building of the warships Indiana, Texas, Oregon, and Columbia. By 1898, with the help of the Carnegie Corporation, no less than ten modern warships, including steel hulls and greater displacements and armaments, had transformed the United States into a legitimate naval power. Seven of these had begun during the Harrison term.[153]', 'Harrison and Secretary of State Blaine were often not the most cordial of friends, but harmonized in an aggressive foreign policy and commercial reciprocity with other nations.[154] Blaine\'s persistent medical problems warranted more of a hands-on effort by Harrison in the conduct of foreign policy. In San Francisco, while on tour of the United States in 1891, Harrison proclaimed that the United States was in a ""new epoch"" of trade and that the expanding navy would protect oceanic shipping and increase American influence and prestige abroad.[155] The First International Conference of American States met in Washington in 1889; Harrison set an aggressive agenda including customs and currency integration and named a bipartisan delegation to the conference, led by John B. Henderson and Andrew Carnegie. The conference failed to achieve any diplomatic breakthrough, due in large part to an atmosphere of suspicion fostered by the Argentinian delegation. It did succeed in establishing an information center that became the Pan American Union.[156] In response to the diplomatic bust, Harrison and Blaine pivoted diplomatically and initiated a crusade for tariff reciprocity with Latin American nations; the Harrison administration concluded eight reciprocity treaties among these countries.[157] On another front, Harrison sent Frederick Douglass as ambassador to Haiti, but failed in his attempts to establish a naval base there.[158]', ""In 1889, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the German Empire were locked in a dispute over control of the Samoan Islands. Historian George H. Ryden's research indicates Harrison played a key role in determining the status of this Pacific outpost by taking a firm stand on every aspect of Samoa conference negotiations; this included selection of the local ruler, refusal to allow an indemnity for Germany, as well as the establishment of a three power protectorate, a first for the U.S.. These arrangements facilitated the future dominant power of the U.S. in the Pacific; Secretary of State Blaine was absent due to complication of lumbago.[159]"", ""Throughout the 1880s various European countries had imposed a ban on importation of United States pork out of an unconfirmed concern of trichinosis; at issue was over one billion pounds of pork products with a value of $80\xa0million annually (equivalent to $2.7\xa0billion in 2023). Harrison engaged Whitelaw Reid, minister to France, and William Walter Phelps, minister to Germany, to restore these exports for the country without delay. Harrison also successfully asked the congress to enact the Meat Inspection Act to eliminate the accusations of product compromise. The president also partnered with Agriculture Secretary Rusk to threaten Germany with retaliation – by initiating an embargo in the U.S. against Germany's highly demanded beet sugar. By September 1891 Germany relented, and was soon followed by Denmark, France and Austria-Hungary.[160]"", 'The first international crisis Harrison faced arose from disputed fishing rights on the Alaskan coast. Canada claimed fishing and sealing rights around many of the Aleutian Islands, in violation of U.S. law. As a result, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships.[161] In 1891, the administration began negotiations with the British that would eventually lead to a compromise over fishing rights after international arbitration, with the British government paying compensation in 1898.[162][163]', ""In 1891, a diplomatic crisis emerged in Chile, otherwise known as the Baltimore Crisis. The American minister to Chile, Patrick Egan, granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. Egan, previously a militant Irish immigrant to the U.S., was motivated by a personal desire to thwart Great Britain's influence in Chile;[164] his action increased tensions between Chile and the United States, which began in the early 1880s when Secretary Blaine had alienated the Chileans in the War of the Pacific."", 'Tensions increased to the brink of war – Harrison threatened to break off diplomatic relations unless the United States received a suitable apology, and said the situation required, ""grave and patriotic consideration"". The president also remarked, ""If the dignity as well as the prestige and influence of the United States are not to be wholly sacrificed, we must protect those who in foreign ports display the flag or wear the colors.""[167] The Navy was also placed on a high level of preparedness.[166] A recuperated Blaine made brief conciliatory overtures to the Chilean government which had no support in the administration; he then reversed course, joined the chorus for unconditional concessions and apology by the Chileans, who ultimately obliged, and war was averted. Theodore Roosevelt later applauded Harrison for his use of the ""big stick"" in the matter.[168][169]', ""In the last days of his administration, Harrison dealt with the issue of Hawaiian annexation. Following a coup d'état against Queen Liliʻuokalani, the new government of Hawaii led by Sanford Dole petitioned for annexation by the United States.[170] Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at Pearl Harbor but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands.[171] The United States consul in Hawaii, John L. Stevens, recognized the new government on February 1, 1893, and forwarded their proposals to Washington. With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day with Harrison's recommendation.[170] The Senate failed to act, and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office.[172][173]"", ""Harrison appointed four justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The first was David Josiah Brewer, a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Brewer, the nephew of Justice Field, had previously been considered for a cabinet position. Shortly after Brewer's nomination, Justice Matthews died, creating another vacancy. Harrison had considered Henry Billings Brown, a Michigan judge and admiralty law expert, for the first vacancy and now nominated him for the second. For the third vacancy, which arose in 1892, Harrison nominated George Shiras. Shiras's appointment was somewhat controversial because his age—sixty—was older than usual for a newly appointed Justice. Shiras also drew the opposition of Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania because they were in different factions of the Pennsylvania Republican party, but his nomination was nonetheless approved. Finally, at the end of his term, Harrison nominated Howell Edmunds Jackson to replace Justice Lamar, who died in January 1893. Harrison knew the incoming Senate would be controlled by Democrats, so he selected Jackson, a respected Tennessee Democrat with whom he was friendly to ensure his nominee would not be rejected. Jackson's nomination was indeed successful, but he died after only two years on the Court.[174]"", ""After he left office, Harrison visited the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in June 1893.[192] After the Expo, Harrison returned to his home in Indianapolis. Harrison had been elected a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in 1882, and was elected as commander (president) of the Ohio Commandery on May 3, 1893. For a few months in 1894, Harrison lived in San Francisco, California, where he gave law lectures at Stanford University.[193] In 1896, some of Harrison's friends in the Republican party tried to convince him to seek the presidency again, but he declined. He traveled around the nation making appearances and speeches in support of William McKinley's candidacy for president.[194]"", ""In 1898, Harrison served as an attorney for the Republic of Venezuela in their British Guiana boundary dispute with the United Kingdom.[197] An international trial was agreed upon; he filed an 800-page brief and traveled to Paris where he spent more than 25 hours in court on Venezuela's behalf. Although he lost the case, his legal arguments won him international renown.[198] In 1899 Harrison attended the First Peace Conference at The Hague.[citation needed]"", ""In 1908, the people of Indianapolis erected the Benjamin Harrison memorial statue, created by Charles Niehaus and Henry Bacon, in honor of Harrison's lifetime achievements as military leader, U.S. Senator, and President of the United States.[215] The statue occupies a site on the south edge of University Park, facing the Birch Bayh Federal Building and United States Courthouse across New York Avenue.[216]""]"

Both scored slowly, averaging more than three and half minutes for each run.[22][54] Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley,[55] who was bowling mainly in order to allow his frontline bowlers to recuperate,[56] broke through his defences with a yorker,[55] dismissing him for 47 after 175 minutes of batting;[55] the English skipper trapped Brown lbw nine runs later to leave Australia 6/225.[22] Australia recovered to 350 on the second morning, and England were then bowled out on the third morning for 215.[25] Australia's top-order scored quickly and Hassett came in with the score at 2/296 after 277 minutes of batting. Yardley bowled Hassett first ball off the inside edge,[57] so Miller came to the crease at 3/296 to face the hat-trick ball. Miller survived a loud lbw appeal to deny the English captain a hat-trick.[58] Australia then declared at 7/460 on the fourth day to leave England a target of 596, which would have taken a world record run-chase for victory.[22] Hassett caught Alec Bedser from the bowling of Bill Johnston as Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 early on the final morning to win by 409 runs.[22][54]"", 'England declared at 8/365 after two overs on the last day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make it more likely to spin.[72] Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.[78]']"

Hay remained active in politics, and from 1879 to 1881 served as Assistant Secretary of State. Afterward, he returned to the private sector, remaining there until President McKinley, of whom he had been a major backer, made him the Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1897. Hay became the Secretary of State the following year."", ""Hay served for nearly seven years as Secretary of State under President McKinley and, after McKinley's assassination, under Theodore Roosevelt. Hay was responsible for negotiating the Open Door Policy, which kept China open to trade with all countries on an equal basis, with international powers. By negotiating the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty with the United Kingdom, the (ultimately unratified) Hay–Herrán Treaty with Colombia, and finally the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty with the newly independent Republic of Panama, Hay also cleared the way for the building of the Panama Canal."", 'Milton Hay desired that his nephew go to Washington as a qualified attorney, and John Hay was admitted to the bar in Illinois on February 4, 1861.[6] On February 11, he embarked with President-elect Lincoln on a circuitous journey to Washington.[18] By this time, several Southern states had seceded to form the Confederate States of America in reaction to the election of Lincoln, seen as an opponent of slavery.[19] When Lincoln was sworn in on March 4, Hay and Nicolay moved into the White House, sharing a shabby bedroom.[a] As there was only authority for payment of one presidential secretary (Nicolay), Hay was appointed to a post in the Interior Department at $1,600 per year,[b] seconded to service at the White House. They were available to Lincoln 24 hours a day.[15] As Lincoln took no vacations as president and worked seven days a week, often until 11\xa0pm (or later, during crucial battles) the burden on his secretaries was heavy.[20]', 'Hay and Nicolay divided their responsibilities, Nicolay tending to assist Lincoln in his office and in meetings, while Hay dealt with the correspondence, which was voluminous. Both men tried to shield Lincoln from office-seekers and others who wanted to meet with the President. Unlike the dour Nicolay, Hay, with his charm, escaped much of the hard feelings from those denied Lincoln\'s presence.[21] Abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson described Hay as ""a nice young fellow, who unfortunately looks about seventeen and is oppressed with the necessity of behaving like seventy.""[22] Hay continued to write, anonymously, for newspapers, sending in columns calculated to make Lincoln appear a sorrowful man, religious and competent, giving of his life and health to preserve the Union.[23] Similarly, Hay served as what Taliaferro deemed a ""White House propagandist,"" in his columns explaining away losses such as that at First Bull Run in July 1861.[24]', 'Hay and Nicolay accompanied Lincoln to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, for the dedication of the cemetery there, where were interred many of those who fell at the Battle of Gettysburg. Although they made much of Lincoln\'s brief Gettysburg Address in their 1890 multi-volume biography of Lincoln, Hay\'s diary states ""the President, in a firm, free way, with more grace than is his wont, said his half-dozen lines of consecration.""[30]', ""Lincoln sent Hay away from the White House on various missions. In August 1861, Hay escorted Mary Lincoln and her children to Long Branch, New Jersey, a resort on the Jersey Shore, both as their caretaker and as a means of giving Hay a much-needed break. The following month, Lincoln sent him to Missouri to deliver a letter to Union General John C. Frémont, who had irritated the President with military blunders and by freeing local slaves without authorization, endangering Lincoln's attempts to keep the border states in the Union.[31]"", 'In July 1864, New York publisher Horace Greeley sent word to Lincoln that there were Southern peace emissaries in Canada. Lincoln doubted that they actually spoke for Confederate President Jefferson Davis, but had Hay journey to New York to persuade the publisher to go to Niagara Falls, Ontario, to meet with them and bring them to Washington. Greeley reported to Lincoln that the emissaries lacked accreditation by Davis, but were confident they could bring both sides together. Lincoln sent Hay to Ontario with what became known as the Niagara Manifesto: that if the South laid down its arms, freed the slaves, and reentered the Union, it could expect liberal terms on other points. The Southerners refused to come to Washington to negotiate.[35]', 'Hay did not accompany the Lincolns to Ford\'s Theatre on the night of April 14, 1865, but remained at the White House, drinking whiskey with Robert Lincoln. When the two were informed that the President had been shot, they hastened to the Petersen House, a boarding house where the stricken Lincoln had been taken. Hay remained by Lincoln\'s deathbed through the night[38] and was present when he died. At the moment of Lincoln\'s death, Hay observed ""a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features"".[39] He heard War Secretary Edwin Stanton\'s declaration, ""Now he belongs to the ages.""[40]', ""By the time President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's administration had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected members of his party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president,[62] a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly took aim at Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.[63]"", ""From May to October 1879, Hay set out to reconfirm his credentials as a loyal Republican, giving speeches in support of candidates and attacking the Democrats. In October, President and Mrs. Hayes came to a reception at Hay's Cleveland home. When Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward resigned later that month, Hay was offered his place and accepted, after some hesitancy because he was considering running for Congress.[75]"", ""John Hay was sworn in as Secretary of State on September 30, 1898. He needed little introduction to Cabinet meetings, and sat at the President's right hand. Meetings were held in the Cabinet Room of the White House, where he found his old office and bedroom each occupied by several clerks. Now responsible for 1,300 federal employees, he leaned heavily for administrative help on his old friend Alvey Adee, the second assistant.[124]"", ""Secretary Hay was at The Fells when McKinley was shot by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, on September 6 in Buffalo. With Vice President Roosevelt and much of the cabinet hastening to the bedside of McKinley, who had been operated on (it was thought successfully) soon after the shooting, Hay planned to go to Washington to manage the communication with foreign governments, but presidential secretary George Cortelyou urged him to come to Buffalo.[149] He traveled to Buffalo on September 10; hearing on his arrival an account of the President's recovery, Hay responded that McKinley would die.[150] He was more cheerful after visiting McKinley, giving a statement to the press, and went to Washington, as Roosevelt and other officials also dispersed. Hay was about to return to New Hampshire on the 13th, when word came that McKinley was dying. Hay remained at his office and the next morning, on the way to Buffalo, the former Rough Rider received from Hay his first communication as head of state, officially informing President Roosevelt of McKinley's death.[151]"", ""Hay's involvement in the efforts to have a canal joining the oceans in Central America went back to his time as Assistant Secretary of State under Hayes, when he served as translator for Ferdinand de Lesseps in his efforts to interest the American government in investing in his canal company. President Hayes was only interested in the idea of a canal under American control, which de Lesseps's project would not be.[159] By the time Hay became Secretary of State, de Lesseps's project in Panama (then a Colombian province) had collapsed, as had an American-run project in Nicaragua.[160] The 1850 Clayton–Bulwer Treaty (between the United States and Britain) forbade the United States from building a Central American canal that it exclusively controlled, and Hay, from early in his tenure, sought the removal of this restriction. But the Canadians, for whose foreign policy Britain was still available, saw the canal matter as their greatest leverage to get other disputes resolved in their favor, persuaded Salisbury not to resolve it independently. Shortly before Hay took office, Britain and the U.S. agreed to establish a Joint High Commission to adjudicate unsettled matters, which met in late 1898 but made slow progress, especially on the Canada-Alaska boundary.[161][162]"", ""Seeing that the Americans were likely to build a Nicaragua Canal, the owners of the defunct French company, including Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who still had exclusive rights to the Panama route, lowered their price. Beginning in early 1902, President Roosevelt became a backer of the latter route, and Congress passed legislation for it, if it could be secured within a reasonable time.[168] In June, Roosevelt told Hay to take personal charge of the negotiations with Colombia.[169] Later that year, Hay began talks with Colombia's acting minister in Washington, Tomás Herrán. The Hay–Herrán Treaty, granting $10\xa0million to Colombia for the right to build a canal, plus $250,000 annually, was signed on January 22, 1903, and ratified by the United States Senate two months later.[170] In August, however, the treaty was rejected by the Colombian Senate.[171]"", 'Roosevelt was minded to build the canal anyway, using an earlier treaty with Colombia that gave the U.S. transit rights in regard to the Panama Railroad. Hay predicted ""an insurrection on the Isthmus [of Panama] against that regime of folly and graft\xa0... at Bogotá"".[172] Bunau-Varilla gained meetings with both men, and assured them that a revolution, and a Panamanian government more friendly to a canal, was coming. In October, Roosevelt ordered Navy ships to be stationed near Panama. The Panamanians duly revolted in early November 1903, with Colombian interference deterred by the presence of U.S. forces. By prearrangement, Bunau-Varilla was appointed representative of the nascent nation in Washington, and quickly negotiated the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, signed on November 18, giving the United States the right to build the canal in a zone 10 miles (16\xa0km) wide, over which the U.S. would exercise full jurisdiction. This was less than satisfactory to the Panamanian diplomats who arrived in Washington shortly after the signing, but they did not dare renounce it. The treaty was approved by the two nations, and work on the Panama Canal began in 1904.[173] Hay wrote to Secretary of War Elihu Root, praising ""the perfectly regular course which the President did follow"" as much preferable to armed occupation of the isthmus.[174]', 'Hay had met the President\'s father, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., during the Civil War, and during his time at the Tribune came to know the adolescent ""Teddy"", twenty years younger than himself.[92] Although before becoming president Roosevelt often wrote fulsome letters of praise to Secretary Hay, his letters to others then and later were less complimentary. Hay felt Roosevelt too impulsive, and privately opposed his inclusion on the ticket in 1900, though he quickly wrote a congratulatory note after the convention.[175]', 'As President and Secretary of State, the two men took pains to cultivate a cordial relationship. Roosevelt read all ten volumes of the Lincoln biography[157] and in mid-1903, wrote to Hay that by then ""I have had a chance to know far more fully what a really great Secretary of State you are"".[171] Hay for his part publicly praised Roosevelt as ""young, gallant, able, [and] brilliant"", words that Roosevelt wrote that he hoped would be engraved on his tombstone.[157]', 'In December 1902, the German government asked Roosevelt to arbitrate its dispute with Venezuela over unpaid debts. Hay did not think this appropriate, as Venezuela also owed the U.S. money, and quickly arranged for the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to step in. Hay supposedly said, as final details were being worked out, ""I have it all arranged. If Teddy will keep his mouth shut until tomorrow noon!""[179] Hay and Roosevelt also differed over the composition of the Joint High Commission that was to settle the Alaska boundary dispute. The commission was to be composed of ""impartial jurists"" and the British and Canadians duly appointed notable judges. Roosevelt appointed politicians, including Secretary Root and Senator Lodge. Although Hay was supportive of the President\'s choices in public, in private he protested loudly to Roosevelt, complained by letter to his friends, and offered his resignation. Roosevelt declined it, but the incident confirmed him in his belief that Hay was too much of an Anglophile to be trusted where Britain was concerned. The American position on the boundary dispute was imposed on Canada by a 4–2 vote, with the one English judge joining the three Americans.[179]', ""Although Hay gave speeches in support of Roosevelt, he spent much of the fall of 1904 at his New Hampshire house or with his younger brother Charles, who was ill in Boston. After the election, Roosevelt asked Hay to remain another four years. Hay asked for time to consider, but the President did not allow it, announcing to the press two days later that Hay would stay at his post. Early 1905 saw futility for Hay, as a number of treaties he had negotiated were defeated or amended by the Senate—one involving the British dominion of Newfoundland due to Senator Lodge's fears it would harm his fisherman constituents. Others, promoting arbitration, were voted down or amended because the Senate did not want to be bypassed in the settlement of international disputes.[185]"", 'By Roosevelt\'s inauguration on March 4, 1905, Hay\'s health was so bad that both his wife and his friend Henry Adams insisted on his going to Europe, where he could rest and get medical treatment. Presidential doctor Presley Rixey issued a statement that Hay was suffering from overwork, but in letters the secretary hinted his conviction that he did not have long to live.[186] An eminent physician in Italy prescribed medicinal baths for Hay\'s heart condition, and he duly journeyed to Bad Nauheim, near Frankfurt, Germany. Kaiser Wilhelm II was among the monarchs who wrote to Hay asking him to visit, though he declined; Belgian King Leopold II succeeded in seeing him by showing up at his hotel, unannounced.[187] Adams suggested that Hay retire while there was still enough life left in him to do so, and that Roosevelt would be delighted to act as his own Secretary of State.[188] Hay jokingly wrote to sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens that ""there is nothing the matter with me except old age, the Senate, and one or two other mortal maladies"".[189]', 'On his return to the United States, despite his family\'s desire to take him to New Hampshire, the secretary went to Washington to deal with departmental business and ""say Ave Caesar! to the President"", as Hay put it.[191] He was pleased to learn that Roosevelt was well on his way to settling the Russo-Japanese War, an action for which the President would win the Nobel Peace Prize.[192] Hay left Washington for the last time on June 23, 1905, arriving in New Hampshire the following day. He died there on July 1 of his heart ailment and complications. Hay was interred in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, near the grave of Garfield, in the presence of Roosevelt and many dignitaries, including Robert Lincoln.[193]', 'In 1902, Hay wrote that when he died, ""I shall not be much missed except by my wife.""[222] Nevertheless, due to his premature death at age 66, he was survived by most of his friends.[223] These included Adams, who although he blamed the pressures of Hay\'s office, where he was badgered by Roosevelt and many senators, for the Secretary of State\'s death, admitted that Hay had remained in the position because he feared being bored. He memorialized his friend in the final pages of his autobiographical The Education of Henry Adams: with Hay\'s death, his own education had ended.[224]', 'Taliaferro suggests that ""if Hay put any\xa0... indelible stamp on history, perhaps it was that he demonstrated how the United States ought to comport itself. He, not Roosevelt, was the adult in charge when the nation and the State Department attained global maturity.""[226] He quotes John St. Loe Strachey, ""All that the world saw was a great gentleman and a great statesman doing his work for the State and for the President with perfect taste, perfect good sense, and perfect good humour"".[226]']"

Batting at number three, his first innings yielded 16 runs, but in the second innings, he scored 71, reaching fifty runs in as many minutes.[9][10] In the second game against Lord Tennyson's XI which began in Kingston on 18 February, Headley scored his maiden first-class century. Having scored 22 not out after the first day's play, he reached 50 runs by playing very carefully but subsequently played more adventurous shots. He hit the bowling of Alan Hilder for four consecutive fours and twice hit Lord Tennyson for three fours in a row. At one point, thirteen of his scoring shots in a row went for four. He was finally out for 211, the highest score at the time by a West Indian batsman against an English team.[10][11] After the innings, Tennyson compared Headley to Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney, batsmen considered among the best who ever played.[12] Headley concluded the series against Tennyson's team with innings of 40 and 71, to give him an aggregate of 409 runs at an average of 81.80. He also took his maiden first class wicket.[9][13]"", 'In 1930 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) undertook a tour of the West Indies which included four Test matches—the first Tests to be played in the West Indies. The MCC side was not at full international strength; it included players who were either just beginning or just ending their international careers,[19] and several star English bowlers were missing.[note 1][20] The first Test was played in Barbados and Headley was selected, making his debut for the West Indies on 11 February 1930—to the disapproval of some Barbadians who thought his place should have gone to a local player. Batting at number three, he played aggressively in the first innings but the crowd barracked him and he was bowled for 21. However, in the second innings he scored 176, becoming the first West Indian to score a century on his Test debut and only their second centurion overall. He shared century partnerships with both Clifford Roach and Frank de Caires, but these were insufficient to force victory, and the match was drawn.[9][21] Headley remained in the Test side for the rest of the series, the only home player other than Roach to appear in all four Tests.[22] In Trinidad, during the second Test, Headley found the unfamiliar conditions difficult—Trinidad was the only Test match ground in the Caribbean which was played on a pitch made from matting instead of grass.[21] Headley scored eight and 39 as West Indies lost the match.[9] The home side levelled the series with their first ever Test victory in the third match of the series, played in British Guiana. In this match Headley became the first West Indian, and only the fifth cricketer of any nation, to score two separate hundreds in a Test match. His first innings of 114 was played mainly in support of Roach, who scored a double century.[23] In the second innings, Headley scored 112 as West Indies batted with a big first innings lead, attacking defensive English bowling.[23]', ""For reasons related to class and race, it had been unthinkable before the war for the West Indies to appoint a black Test captain, but the postwar world saw social and political changes in the Caribbean.[103] Although opinion was still divided over the merits of a black captain, Headley was appointed as one of the West Indian captains for the series against the England team which toured the Caribbean in 1948.[104] Crab Nethersole, the former Jamaican captain and member of the Board of Control for cricket, argued Headley should be outright captain but a compromise was reached.[105] Headley was scheduled to captain the first and fourth Test matches, played in Barbados and Jamaica, and the white players Gerry Gomez and John Goddard were given the captaincy of the second and third matches.[104] In the event, Headley only played in the first Test. In the first innings, he scored 29 but strained his back while fielding. Batting towards the end of West Indies' second innings, he scored seven not out. Rain helped England to draw the match.[106] Headley's back caused him to miss the second and third Tests, but he was fit enough to play for Jamaica when the tourists arrived there to play two games against the island before the fourth and final Test. After the first island game, in which he scored 65, Headley's request to miss the second match to rest his back was refused by the Jamaican Board. He scored 36 not out, but aggravated his back pains and he withdrew from the final Test. West Indies won this game under the captaincy of Goddard, who had earlier led West Indies to victory in the third Test. He was subsequently chosen to captain West Indies in India in 1948–49,[9][106] despite Headley's availability and apparently superior claims to the position.[107]""]"

He was then inducted into the family living, as rector of Hodnet;[37] he was later to describe his role as ""a half-way station between a parson and a squire"".[38] At first he divided his time between his parish and Oxford, where he fulfilled duties at All Souls. He had not at this time determined his own doctrinal position; writing to Thornton he admitted that he was still searching: ""Pray for me, my dear friend, that I may have my eyes open to the truth ... and if it please God that I persevere in his ministry I may undertake the charge with a quiet mind and a good conscience"".[39] A High churchman by upbringing, Heber was a strong opponent of factional rivalry; he eventually found a place around the midpoint of the Anglican spectrum between the High Church and evangelical wings, with perhaps a slight inclination towards the evangelicals.[6]', ""In 1817 Heber accepted the post of canon at St Asaph, the relative proximity of which enabled the extra duties to be carried out without interfering with his parish work.[44] His main literary task during these years was a biography and critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor; the works, with Heber's critique, were published in 15 volumes between 1820 and 1822. This period of Heber's life was saddened by the death, on 24 December 1818, of his infant daughter after a short illness.[44] Two more daughters were born later, in 1821 and 1824 respectively; both lived to adulthood.[6] In 1822 Heber was elected to the church office of Preacher of Lincoln's Inn, which would require a regular term of residence in London. He saw this both as an extension of his service to the Church and as a means of renewing contact with old friends.[44]"", ""At the start of the 19th century the Anglican authorities officially disapproved of the singing of hymns in churches, other than metrical psalms, although there was considerable informal hymn-singing in parishes.[45] Heber, according to the poet John Betjeman, was a professed admirer of the hymns of John Newton and William Cowper, and was one of the first High Church Anglicans to write his own. In all he wrote 57, mainly between 1811 and 1821. Heber wished to publish his hymns in a collection, in which he proposed to include some by other writers. In October 1820 he sought help from the Bishop of London, William Howley, in obtaining official recognition of his collection from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a noncommittal reply Howley suggested that Heber should publish the hymns, although he proposed to withhold episcopal approval until public reaction could be gauged. Heber began preparing the publication, but was unable to complete arrangements before his departure for India in 1823. The collection was eventually published in 1827, after Heber's death, as Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year.[45]"", 'One whose popularity has waned is the missionary hymn ""From Greenland\'s Icy Mountains"", written in 1819 as part of a country-wide campaign on behalf of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Watson describes this as ""a conspicuous example of that fervent belief to convert the world to Christianity which led Heber and others to lay down their lives in the mission field"",[50] and while widely sung until the second half of the 20th century, it was for instance omitted from the 1982 revision of the Episcopal Church hymnal.[51] Betjeman felt that in the modern world, the words of this hymn seem patronising and insensitive to other beliefs, with references to ""...every prospect pleases and only man is vile"", and to ""the heathen in his blindness [bowing] down to wood and stone"".[49] These phrases and the assumptions behind them offended Gandhi, who drew attention to them in a speech at YMCA Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1925: ""My own experience in my travels throughout India has been to the contrary ... [Man] is not vile. He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are, possibly more so"".[52] Other Heber texts remain popular, and the Dictionary of North American Hymnology notes that most of his hymns remain in use.[53]', ""The see of Calcutta had been established in 1814. It covered much of the Indian subcontinent and Ceylon, together with Australia and parts of southern Africa.[6] The first bishop, Thomas Middleton, who had been consecrated in 1814, died in office in July 1822.[54] At the time the head of the Indian Board of Control was Charles Williams-Wynn, an old Oxford friend of Heber's. In December 1822 Williams-Wynn wrote to Heber, not directly offering his friend the post—the wording appeared to anticipate a refusal—but nevertheless leaving Heber the opportunity to claim the office, should he wish.[55] Heber had a longstanding interest in the work of overseas missions; he supported not only the SPG but also its more recently formed evangelical sister-body, the Church Missionary Society (CMS), and while still at Oxford had helped to found the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS).[56]"", ""The new bishop arrived in Calcutta on 10 October 1823. After his ceremonial installation by the Governor General, Lord Amherst, Heber preached his first sermon as bishop on Sunday 12 October, in St John's Cathedral Church.[59] He faced many challenges arising from tasks unfinished at the time of his predecessor's death and from the long hiatus without a bishop.  A major area of concern was Bishop's College, a training school for local clergy founded by Middleton in 1820, the development of which had stalled due to financial and management problems. Heber reinvigorated the project by extensive fundraising, by persuading the government to increase its grant of land, and by restarting the building programme; within a few months the college boasted a library and a new chapel.[60] In June 1824 Heber, using a power provided to him by recent Act of Parliament, ordained as deacon the first native Indian to receive Holy Orders.[61]"", 'It took four months for reports of Heber\'s death to reach England. At Oxford, representatives of Brasenose and All Souls opened a fund for an appropriate memorial; this idea was taken over by Williams-Wynn, who wanted a national rather than an Oxford-based monument. From the large sum collected, Chantrey was paid £3,000 for a huge marble sculpture that was placed in St Paul\'s Cathedral, London.[83][84][85] More modest memorials were raised in the parish churches at Hodnet and Malpas.[77] At the time of Heber\'s episcopacy, Australia formed part of the Diocese of Calcutta and, following Heber\'s death, a schoolhouse was erected at St Paul\'s, Cobbitty, New South Wales and named the Heber Chapel.[86] [87] During his time in St Asaph, Heber became a good friend of the poet, Felicia Hemans, and in 1826 she published a poetic tribute ""To the Memory of Bishop Heber"" in The Asiatic Journal.[88] Another tribute was provided by Letitia Elizabeth Landon with her poetical illustration to an engraving of a painting by H. Melville on the Death of Heber in Fisher\'s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839.[89]', 'Heber\'s pioneering commitment to the mission fields was expressed, half a century after his death, by the author Charlotte Mary Yonge: ""Heber was one of the first English churchmen who perceived that to enlarge her borders and strengthen her stakes was the bounden duty of the living Church"".[92] He led through example, and through his writings which ""did much to spread knowledge of, and therefore interest in, the field of labour in which he died"".[93] The Anglican Church of Canada commemorates Heber on 4 April each year.[94]']"

These hours were the happiest of my life, and now it is all, all over.""[12]', 'Princess Helena began an early flirtation with her father\'s former librarian, Carl Ruland, following his appointment to the Royal Household on the recommendation of Baron Stockmar in 1859. He was trusted enough to teach German to Helena\'s brother, the young Prince of Wales, and was described by the Queen as ""useful and able"".[17] When the Queen discovered that Helena had grown romantically attached to a royal servant, he was promptly dismissed back to his native Germany, and he never lost the Queen\'s hostility.[18]', ""The engagement was declared on 5 December 1865, and despite the Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion.[30] The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back.[31] The main participants filed into the chapel to the sound of Beethoven's Triumphal March, creating a spectacle only marred by the abrupt disappearance of Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids.[32] Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters.[33] The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.[34]"", ""Helena's favourite son, Prince Christian Victor, died in 1900, followed three months later by her mother Queen Victoria, who died at Osborne House on 22 January 1901. The new King, Edward VII, did not have close ties with his surviving sisters, with the exception of Princess Louise. Helena's nephew, Prince Alexander of Battenberg (later Marquess of Carisbrooke) recorded that Queen Alexandra was jealous of the royal family, and would not invite her sisters-in-law to Sandringham.[65] Moreover, Alexandra never fully reconciled herself to Helena and Christian following their marriage controversy in the 1860s.[66]"", 'In 1902, Prince and Princess Christian moved to Schomberg House, 77–78 Pall Mall, London, half of which is now part of the Oxford and Cambridge Club.[69]', ""In 1917, in response to the wave of anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family's German titles and styles, so Helena and her daughters simply became Princess Christian, Princess Helena Victoria and  Princess Marie Louise with no territorial designation. Helena's surviving son, Albert, fought on the side of the Prussians, though he made it clear that he would not fight against his mother's country.[73] In the same year, on 28 October, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House. Helena's last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg House and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households.

However, doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games.[13] After several difficult months in England, Henry even conceded that he had to ""be re-taught everything about the art of striking.""[13] These doubts were dispelled when he ended his first season at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26.[24] Arsenal finished second in the Premier League behind Manchester United, and lost in the UEFA Cup Final against Galatasaray.[12]', ""After training with Arsenal during the MLS off-season, Henry re-signed for the club on a two-month loan deal on 6 January 2012.

She was known for her headstrong independence, spirited personality, and outspokenness, cultivating a screen persona that matched this public image, and regularly playing strong-willed, sophisticated women. She worked in a varied range of genres, from screwball comedy to literary drama, which earned her various accolades, including four Academy Awards for Best Actress—a record for any performer.', ""Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life as she tackled Shakespearean stage productions and a range of literary roles. She found a niche playing mature, independent, and sometimes unmarried women such as in The African Queen (1951), a persona the public embraced. Hepburn received three more Academy Awards for her performances in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), The Lion in Winter (1968), and On Golden Pond (1981). In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which later became her focus. She made her final screen appearance at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96."", ""Hepburn's next feature, Stage Door (1937), paired her with Ginger Rogers in a role that mirrored her own life—that of a wealthy society girl trying to make it as an actress.[92] Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which gave her top billing over Rogers.[93] The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but it was not the box-office hit RKO had hoped for.[92] Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio continued its commitment to resurrecting her popularity.[94] She was cast in Howard Hawks' screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby (1938), where she played a flighty heiress who loses a leopard while trying to woo a palaeontologist (Cary Grant). She approached the physical comedy of the film with confidence,[94] and took tips on comedic timing from her co-star Walter Catlett.[95] Bringing Up Baby was acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box office.[96] With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers' rejection of Hepburn.[97]"", 'In 1951, Hepburn filmed The African Queen, her first movie in Technicolor. She played Rose Sayer, a prim missionary living in German East Africa at the outbreak of World War I. Co-starring Humphrey Bogart, The African Queen was shot mostly on location in the Belgian Congo, an opportunity Hepburn embraced.[144] It proved a difficult experience, however, and Hepburn became ill with dysentery during filming.[145] Later in life, she released a memoir about the experience.[146] The movie was released at the end of 1951 to popular support and critical acclaim,[147] and gave Hepburn her fifth Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards while garnering Bogart his only Academy Award for Best Actor. The first successful film she had made without Tracy since The Philadelphia Story a decade earlier, it proved that she could be a hit without him and fully reestablished her popularity.[148]', 'Hepburn quickly returned to acting after Tracy\'s death, choosing to occupy herself as a remedy against grief.[182] She received numerous scripts[183] and chose to play Eleanor of Aquitaine in The Lion in Winter (1968), a part she called ""fascinating"".[184] She read extensively in preparation for the role, in which she starred opposite Peter O\'Toole.[185] Filming took place in Montmajour Abbey in the south of France, an experience she loved despite being—according to director Anthony Harvey—""enormously vulnerable"" throughout.[186] John Russell Taylor of The Times suggested that Eleanor was ""the performance of her ... career"", and proved that she was ""a growing, developing, still surprising actress"".[187] The movie was nominated in all the major categories at the Academy Awards, and for the second year running Hepburn won the Oscar for Best Actress (shared with Barbra Streisand for Funny Girl).[188] The role, combined with her performance in Guess Who\'s Coming to Dinner, also received a British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) for Best Actress. Hepburn\'s next appearance was in The Madwoman of Chaillot (1969), which she filmed in Nice immediately after completing The Lion in Winter.[189] The picture was a failure critically and financially, and reviews targeted Hepburn for giving a misguided performance.[190] By the end of 1969, she was voted the most popular female star in America by Quigley\'s Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, making a rare occurrence of an actress over 50 to achieve such a position.', 'Hepburn made her only appearance at the Academy Awards in 1974, to present the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to Lawrence Weingarten. She received a standing ovation, and joked with the audience, ""I\'m very happy I didn\'t hear anyone call out, \'It\'s about time\'.""[202] The following year, she was paired with John Wayne in the western Rooster Cogburn, a sequel to his Oscar-winning film True Grit. Echoing her African Queen character, Hepburn played a deeply religious unmarried woman who teams up with a masculine loner to avenge a family member\'s death.[198] The movie received mediocre reviews. Its casting was enough to draw some people to the box office, but it did not meet studio expectations and was only moderately successful.[203]', 'In 1976, Hepburn returned to Broadway for a three-month run of Enid Bagnold\'s play A Matter of Gravity. The role of eccentric Mrs. Basil was deemed a perfect showcase for the actress,[204] and the play was popular despite poor reviews.[205] It later went on a successful nationwide tour.[206] During its Los Angeles run, Hepburn fractured her hip, but she chose to continue the tour performing in a wheelchair.[207] That year, she was voted ""Favorite Motion Picture Actress"" by the People\'s Choice Awards.[208]', ""Hepburn won four Academy Awards, the record number for a performer, and received a total of 12 Oscar nominations for Best Actress—a number surpassed only by Meryl Streep.[346] Hepburn also holds the record for the longest time span between first and last Oscar nominations, at 48 years.[346] She received two awards and five nominations from the British Academy Film Awards, one award and six nominations from the Emmy Awards, eight Golden Globe Award nominations, two Tony Award nominations, and awards from the Cannes Film Festival, Venice Film Festival, the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the People's Choice Awards, and others. Hepburn was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1979. She also won a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1979 and received the Kennedy Center Honors, which recognize a lifetime of accomplishments in the arts, in 1990.[347][348]""]"

The touring team's first match on arrival was against South Australia and Hill batted well, scoring exactly 200.[18] The First Test was played in Sydney and a minor controversy ensued when officials abandoned the first day's play due to earlier heavy rain without consulting the two captains.[19] The delay did not seem to affect the English who batted first and scored 551, including centuries by Ranjitsinhji and Archie MacLaren. The Australians were forced to follow-on after making 237. Batting again, Hill scored 96 but England managed to win the match by nine wickets.[20] The Second Test was played in Melbourne and Australia fought back, winning by an innings and 55\xa0runs with Hill scoring 58.[21] Another innings victory in the Third Test in Adelaide saw Australia leading the series two Tests to one.[18]"", 'The teams returned to Melbourne for the Fourth Test. England started the match brilliantly, reducing Australia to 6/58[22] on a pitch that assisted the bowlers.[5] Hill, aged just 20, was watching at the non-striker\'s end as the wickets fell. Hugh Trumble came to join him and together they began to rescue the Australian innings. When Hill reached his maiden Test century, he had scored all but 42 of his side\'s runs.[5] Hill played balls pitched outside leg stump particularly well and drove beautifully throughout the innings.[23] At the tea interval, Hill, feeling refreshed, mentioned to Trumble that he thought he would ""have a go at them now"". The experienced Trumble cautioned Hill, replying ""You young devil, you have to stop there. Go along as you have been doing.""[5] Hill and Trumble made 165\xa0runs batting together, still a record for a seventh wicket partnership in Ashes Tests.[23] Hill was 182\xa0not\xa0out at the end of the day\'s play, the highest first-day innings against England in Australia, and leaving the ground was greeted by a barrage of photographers. After a rest day, Hill added only six more runs before being dismissed at last by Hearne. His innings remains the highest in Ashes Tests by a player under 21.[5] Batting for 294\xa0minutes he gave only the one chance at dismissal.[23] The journalist and former Test player Tom Horan wrote ""Hill\'s innings will be talked of when the smallest boy who saw it will be white with the snows of time.""[5] Australia won the Test by 8\xa0wickets to recover the Ashes.[24] That summer, Hill scored 1,196\xa0runs in 19\xa0innings including five centuries, the first Australian to score 1,000\xa0runs in a home season.[5]', 'For the first time under the auspices of the Marylebone Cricket Club, an English team travelled to Australia for the 1903–04 season to contest the Ashes. Contrary to expectations before the tour, the English won the series and the Ashes three Tests to two.[44] Hill trailed Trumper and Noble in the series averages, making 276\xa0runs at 27.60 without ever getting to 100 in an innings.[45] In the First Test, Hill was at the centre of what Wisden described as a ""very regrettable and indeed disgraceful [crowd] demonstration"".[46] Batting with Trumper, Hill had run well past the stumps at the bowler\'s end for a fourth run. The English return gave the Australian pair an opportunity for an overthrow. Hill had to run the entire length of the pitch. Albert Relf at mid-on gathered and threw to the wicket-keeper, Dick Lilley who removed the bails and appealed for the run out. Umpire Bob Crockett gave Hill out. Hill could not believe the decision as the ball had passed behind him when he slid his bat to make his ground.[3] The crowd were also convinced that Hill was not out and began to hoot, chanting ""Crock!, Crock!, Crock!""[5] Bottles were thrown onto the surrounding cycle track and the English captain Plum Warner threatened to take his team from the ground. At the end of the day, Crockett required a police escort when leaving the ground.[5] Hill\'s best performance of the series was at his home town, Adelaide, in the Third Test. Hill scored 88 before being dismissed by Ted Arnold, caught by the wicket-keeper. Australia won the Test by 216\xa0runs.[47]']"

A member of the Republican Party, Hobart was an influential New Jersey businessman, politician, and political operative prior to his vice presidency.', ""As vice president, Hobart proved a popular figure in Washington and was a close adviser to McKinley. Hobart's tact and good humor were valuable to the President, as in mid-1899 when Secretary of War Russell Alger failed to understand that McKinley wanted him to leave office. Hobart invited Alger to his New Jersey summer home and broke the news to the secretary, who submitted his resignation to McKinley on his return to Washington. Hobart died of heart disease in 1899, aged 55. His place on the Republican ticket in 1900 was taken by Theodore Roosevelt, who succeeded as president after McKinley's assassination in 1901."", 'In 1874, still only age\xa030, he was voted Speaker of the Assembly.[22] In 1876, he was nominated for the New Jersey Senate seat for Passaic County. He was elected to a three-year term and he was re-elected in 1879. In 1881 and 1882, he served as President of the state Senate, becoming the first man to lead both houses of the legislature.[25] In 1883, he was the Republican nominee in the election for United States Senate—until 1913, senators were elected by state legislatures. As the Democrats were in the majority, the nomination was a way of honoring Hobart for his political service. When he was asked his feelings about the nomination, he responded, ""I do not worry about things that do not come my way."" The complimentary nomination would prove to be Hobart\'s only electoral defeat.[22][26]', 'Not for himself, but for our state; not for his ambition, but to give to the Nation the highest type of public official do we come to this convention, by the command of our state and in the name of the Republican Party of New Jersey—unconquered and unconquerable, undivided and indivisible—with our united voices speaking for all that counts for good citizenship in our state, and nominate to you for the office of Vice-President of the Republic, Garret A. Hobart of New Jersey.', 'McKinley was nominated for president on the first ballot. Hobart described his subsequent first-ballot nomination for vice president as a tribute from his friends, but Hatfield noted, ""it came equally as a tribute from [Hanna, who] wanted a ticket to satisfy the business interests of America, and Hobart, a corporate lawyer, fit that requirement perfectly"".[28] Although a Hobart nomination had been talked about at least since Griggs\' victory the previous November, Hobart expressed reluctance in a letter to his wife from the convention: ""It looks to me I will be nominated for Vice-President whether I want it or not, and as I get nearer to the point where I may, I am dismayed at the thought\xa0 ... If I want a nomination, everything is going my way. But when I realize all that it means in work, worry, and loss of home and bliss, I am overcome, so overcome I am simply miserable.""[28] Despite Hobart\'s expressed hesitation, he was welcomed home by a crowd of 15,000 at the Paterson Armory. City officials, feeling they had insufficient fireworks to properly honor Hobart, obtained more from New York City.[39]', 'The Panic of 1893 had led to hard times in the United States, and the effects were still felt in 1896. One proposal to cure the economic malaise was ""Free Silver""; that the government would accept silver bullion and return it to the depositor, struck into silver dollars. At the time, the silver in a dollar coin was worth $.53. Implementation of the proposals would increase the money supply and cause difficulties in international trade with nations that remained on the gold standard. Proponents argued that the increased money supply would stimulate the economy. President Grover Cleveland was firmly for the gold standard, a stance which bitterly divided the Democratic Party. Most Republicans were for the gold standard, though some, mostly from the West, were ""Silver Republicans"".[45] The Democrats in early July nominated for president an eloquent silver supporter, former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan, whose Cross of Gold speech at the convention catapulted him to the nomination.[46] The selection of Bryan prompted a wave of popular support for the Democrats.[47]', ""Together with Pennsylvania Senator Matthew Quay, Hobart ran the McKinley campaign's New York City office, often making the short journey from Paterson for strategy meetings. The vice-presidential candidate emulated McKinley in giving speeches from his front porch; unlike McKinley he also addressed rallies. In October, he made a short tour of New Jersey to campaign, expressing relief to his wife when it came to a close. On November 3, 1896, the voters cast their ballots in most states; a nervous Hobart spent the day at his office. Special telegraph wires had been attached to his home; at 8:30 in the evening, they conveyed the news to him that McKinley and Hobart had won. The Republican ticket won New Jersey, together with the entire Northeast. The following week, Vice President-elect Hobart attended Rutgers' 130th-anniversary celebrations as guest of honor. The member of the Class of 1863 was now Rutgers' most prominent graduate.[39]"", 'Hobart spent much of the four months between election and inauguration reading about the vice presidency, preparing for the move, and winding down some business affairs. He did not, however, resign from the boards of corporations which would not have business before the federal government. ""It would be highly ridiculous for me to resign from the different companies in which I am officer and a stockholder whose interests are not in the least affected, or likely to be, by my position as Vice President.""[49] On March 2, 1897, Hobart and his family left Paterson to travel to Washington by special train.[50] On March 4, he was inaugurated as vice president in the Senate Chamber.[51] The Chicago Daily News predicted, ""Garret A. Hobart will not be seen or heard until, after four years, he emerges from the impenetrable vacuum of the Vice Presidency.""[52]', 'The vice president had in recent administrations been considered a relatively low-level political functionary, whose activities were generally limited to the constitutional function of presiding over the Senate. Hobart, however, became a close adviser to McKinley and his Cabinet members, although he was not called upon to attend Cabinet meetings. Reporter Arthur Wallace Dunn wrote of Hobart in 1922, ""for the first time in my recollection, and the last for that matter, the Vice President was recognized as somebody, as a part of the Administration, and as a part of the body over which he presided"".[56]', 'Through late 1897 and early 1898, many Americans called for the United States to intervene in Cuba, then a Spanish colony revolting against the mother country. These calls greatly increased in February 1898, when the American battleship Maine sank in Havana harbor after an explosion. McKinley sought delay, hoping to settle the disputes peacefully, but in April 1898, Hobart told the President that the Senate would act against Spain whether McKinley liked it or not. McKinley gave in; Congress declared war on April 25, beginning the Spanish–American War, and Hobart sent McKinley a pen with which to sign the declaration.[57]', 'Hobart was more assertive as U.S. Senate president than his predecessors had been. It was customary for the vice president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation.[58] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that ""I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them. If they know a whole lot of things I don\'t know, I also know a whole lot of things they don\'t know. And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one, after all.""[59] Hobart was so successful at guiding the administration\'s legislative agenda through the Senate that he became known as the ""assistant President"".[14]', 'Hobart was constant in his attendance at the Senate; one onlooker called him a ""chronic audience"".[60] Vice President Hobart cast his tie-breaking vote only once, using it to defeat an amendment which would have promised self-government to the Philippines, one of the possessions which the United States had taken from Spain after the war.[59] Hobart was instrumental in securing the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the war; according to McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan, Hobart was ""almost the president\'s alter ego, [turning] every screw with his legendary politeness"".[61]', 'By late 1898, Hobart was ill with a serious heart ailment, which he at first concealed from the public. He continued his responsibilities in the U.S. Senate, but nearly collapsed after delivering an address closing the session. He accompanied the president on a vacation trip to Hanna\'s winter home in Thomasville, Georgia, but quickly contracted the flu and returned to Washington, D.C.. By April 1899, Hobart\'s illness was well known, though Hanna assured media that Hobart would be on the ticket in the 1900 election, saying, ""nothing but death or an earthquake can stop the re-nomination of Vice President Hobart"".[65]', 'After a vacation with the McKinleys on Lake Champlain, Hobart returned to Paterson in September. On November 1, 1899, the government announced that Hobart would not return to public life. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and he died on November 21, 1899, at age\xa055.[64] President McKinley told the family, ""No one outside of this home feels this loss more deeply than I do.""[69]', ""Foster Voorhees, the New Jersey governor, ordered that state buildings be draped in mourning for 30\xa0days, and that flags be flown at half staff until Hobart's funeral.[70] Hobart's home, Carroll Hall, was opened to the public for four hours so that citizens might pass by his open casket; 12,000\xa0people did so. Hobart was laid to rest at Cedar Lawn Cemetery in Paterson after a large public funeral, attended by President McKinley and many high government officials. Although the large government delegation precluded many local residents from attending the service, a crowd of 50,000 came to Paterson to honor Hobart.[71]"", ""The public increasingly identified Republicans with the union of big business, big money, and big government, a union that ignited a Progressive reaction after 1900. Vice President Garret A. Hobart directed that union as lawyer, business receiver and director, and New Jersey Republican. He represented everything Progressives hated: a railroad advocate when railroads became America's most mistrusted industry, a corporate attorney who facilitated the agglomeration of capital when the public revolted against monopolies and trusts, a financial operator who used his political insight to capture lucrative business opportunities, and a national leader who moved easily between the worlds of political pull and economic power. As much as Hanna or any Gilded Age business-politician, Hobart symbolized the era.[75]"", 'During his vice presidency, Hobart was asked to select a sculptor to create a marble bust of his likeness for the United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection. However, he delayed the decision and died before he could select someone. Jennie Hobart later chose the prominent New Jersey sculptor Frank Edwin Elwell, and Elwell completed it in 1901. That same year, it was placed in the U.S. Capitol Building.[76]']"

He played few large innings,[97] but was very effective in high-pressure games,[96][98] and scored 2,376 runs at 41.68.[39] Bowling more frequently than in other seasons, Hobbs took 28 first-class wickets.[42] Against Oxford University, Hobbs bowled throughout the second innings to take seven wickets for 56 runs, the best figures of his career.[34][97]', 'Hobbs signed a new contract worth £440 (£28,463 in 2021 terms) a season before the 1924 season.[181] His form recovered to the extent that his biographer, John Arlott, described it as the beginning of ""his quite phenomenal second lease of cricketing life"".[182] Batting conditions were good throughout the summer and Hobbs\' opening partnership with Sandham for Surrey began to approach its peak of effectiveness.[183] Hobbs also established an opening partnership with Yorkshire\'s Herbert Sutcliffe; the pair had opened together briefly in previous seasons and were chosen to open in a Test trial early in 1924, beginning a six-year Test association.[5][184] They were often successful in difficult batting conditions;[5] Hobbs, generally the dominant partner, usually faced more of the bowling.[185] By the time of his retirement, they had opened the batting 38 times in Tests, shared 15 century opening partnerships, and added 3,249 runs together;[82] their average partnership was 87.81, the highest in all Tests for a pair of opening batsmen as of 2016.[notes 9][81][186] In all first-class matches, they had added 100 for the first wicket 26 times and had an average partnership of over 77.[45][149] As with Hobbs\' other partnerships, they ran well between the wickets, and established a particular reputation for reliability; according to McKinstry, they became an ""English institution"".[187] The cricket writer Gerald Howat suggests that ""\'Hobbs and Sutcliffe\' became almost a synonym for English stability.""[5]']"

The reports further alleged that some others, including Howard, appeared at several summer basketball camps together, which was a possible violation of NCAA rules.[76] At the beginning of his 1992–93 sophomore season, Michigan returned its top nine scorers and began the season ranked number one in the country by the Associated Press.[77] Michigan lost its second game of the season in a rematch with Duke.[78] Howard was described as the steadiest player on the team that season by coach Fisher.[79] During the season, Howard purchased a million-dollar disability insurance policy approved by the NCAA under the Exceptional Student Athlete Disability Insurance Program available to student-athletes who are projected to be chosen high in the NBA, National Football League (NFL), and Major League Baseball drafts.[80]', 'On April 18, Howard announced his intention to enter the 1994 NBA draft.[100] The following day, Rose announced he would enter the draft as well.[101] Howard was 37 credit hours short of University of Michigan degree requirements, but said he intended to keep his promise to his grandmother that he would earn his diploma.[102]\nHoward left Michigan after being named an Associated Press third team All-American during his junior year, and was taken by the Washington Bullets fifth overall in the 1994 NBA Draft.[103] Howard was represented by David Falk.[104]', ""Entering the 1994–95\xa0season, the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement, and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began. He continued to train in Chicago in late September amidst rumors that his draft rights could be traded to another team.[104] While holding out, he was rumored to be part of a trade package with the Chicago Bulls that included Calbert Cheaney and a first-round draft choice in exchange for Scottie Pippen.[112][113] Another rumor had Howard being packaged with Rex Chapman and Don MacLean for Pippen.[114] On November 9, eleventh overall 1994 NBA draft selection Carlos Rogers signed an NBA contract, making Howard the last first-round selection without a contract.[115] He missed most of the first month of the season and resided at an O'Hare Airport hotel while protracted talks continued.[112] Howard's agent David Falk said that one of the main problems was that the Bullets wanted Howard to sign for a lower average salary than number six selection Sharone Wright.[7] The Bullets stuck to a 10-year, $30 million ($61.7 million in 2023 dollars[116]) offer.[117] On November 17,[118] Howard signed what was believed to be a 12-year, $37.5 million ($77.1 million) contract.[112] Howard's contract, which Sports Illustrated later said was an 11-year $36 million ($74 million) deal, had an escape clause.[7] Once he signed, he was reunited with Michigan teammate Webber as a member of the Bullets.[119] Webber, who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season,[120] was traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Bullets on November 18 for Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft choices.[118]"", ""After averaging 17 points per game as a rookie and more than 22 per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions. The Bullets offered Howard an $89 million contract, but the Miami Heat outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth $98 to $101 million. However, according to the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the salary cap by excluding performance bonuses for Tim Hardaway and P. J. Brown and failing to account for the impact of renegotiating Alonzo Mourning's contract before coming to terms with Howard.[137] The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard's $9 million for the 1996–97 season placed the Heat over the cap.[137][138] Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5. He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $100 million;[139][140] his seven-year contract was worth $105 million (equivalent to $204,000,000 in 2023). The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign Tracy Murray and Lorenzo Williams if they forfeited their 1997 NBA draft first-round selection rights.[141] The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player.[138] The Heat pursued legal remedy in Florida state courts, seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract.[141] Although an arbitration case involving the two contracts that Howard had signed appeared likely, ESPN reported that the Heat dropped their legal pursuit of Howard.[142] The league moved for federal jurisdiction although the case remained on the docket for New York University Law professor Daniel Collins to serve as arbitrator on three issues. Meanwhile, the Heat's contract was protected by a temporary injunction in Florida state court, which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract.[134] The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team, especially head coach Pat Riley, continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid.[143][144] If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5 million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season. By dropping their actions, the Heat avoided any possible penalties.[145]"", ""Howard agreed to terms with the Dallas Mavericks on October 30, 2007, but was not able to officially sign until the next day, when he cleared waivers.[230][231] Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly.

After working for the Canadian government as an engineer, he began his own firm and became wealthy. In 1935, he was recruited as a Liberal candidate for the House of Commons of Canada by Mackenzie King. The Liberals won the election in a landslide and Howe won his seat. Mackenzie King appointed him to the Cabinet. There, he took major parts in many new enterprises, including the founding of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and Trans-Canada Air Lines (today Air Canada). Howe played a crucial role in Canada\'s war effort during WWII and recruited many corporate executives (as ""dollar-a-year-men"") to serve as executives in wartime enterprises.', ""Howe was impatient with parliamentary debates for his proposals, causing him to struggle with gaining popularity amongst parliamentarians; he was often accused of dictatorial conduct by the Opposition. As the Liberal government entered its third decade, it and Howe came to be seen as arrogant. The Government's attempt to impose closure in the 1956 Pipeline Debate led to major controversy in the House of Commons. In the 1957 election, Howe's actions and policies were made an issue by Opposition leader John Diefenbaker. Howe faced a serious challenge in his riding, but was expected to make speeches elsewhere as a major Liberal leader. Howe lost his seat in the election, and Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, ending almost 22\xa0years of Liberal rule. Howe returned to the private sector, accepting a number of corporate directorships, and died suddenly of a heart attack in December 1960."", 'In the 1940 election, Howe had little trouble being re-elected, and 184\xa0Liberals were returned to Ottawa, the greatest total by any party to that point.[43] Mackenzie King appointed Howe as Minister of Munitions and Supply. Liking his job at Transport, Howe was reluctant to move, but the Prime Minister persuaded him.[44] The function of the new department was the complete mobilization of all Canadian resources to support the war effort.[45] Howe initially retained the Transport portfolio as well; on 8 July 1940, he turned over responsibility for that portfolio to Arthur Cardin, although Howe retained control of the CBC and Trans-Canada Air Lines.[46]', 'In October 1944, Mackenzie King appointed Howe Minister of Reconstruction.[59] Howe had an excellent reputation for his successful overhaul of the Canadian economy, and Mackenzie King feared he would return to the private sector to amass another fortune in business. Among those who urged Howe to remain was the Minister of Justice, Louis St. Laurent, with whom Howe forged a strong relationship.[60] The Prime Minister obtained a dissolution of Parliament in April 1945 and in the ensuing election, the Liberals obtained a bare majority.[61] Howe was intensively involved in Liberal fundraising,[62] and campaigned nationally for its candidates. He was easily returned in Port Arthur, taking just over half of all votes cast, with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (the predecessor of the New Democratic Party) a distant second.[63]', ""After the war, Mackenzie King recommended to the British government that two Cabinet ministers be appointed to the Imperial Privy Council, but not Howe. When the honours were announced on New Year's Day 1946, Howe told the Prime Minister that he felt his war service was being slighted and threatened his resignation. Mackenzie King arranged for Howe to receive the honour in June. This created more ill feelings among other members of the Cabinet; two more were elevated in the 1947 New Year's Honours, after which the Prime Minister refused to consider any more.[70]"", ""In February 1947, Mackenzie King fell ill with pneumonia and, after recovering, spent a month on vacation in the United States, with St. Laurent (by then Secretary of State for External Affairs) as Acting Prime Minister.[71] In July, Minister of National Defence Brooke Claxton warned Mackenzie King that the issue of the Prime Minister's age and the uncertainty of the succession was causing political difficulties for the Liberals. Mackenzie King consulted Howe, who bluntly stated that it was best that Mackenzie King resign while still retaining his full faculties and before a crisis erupted. After the talk, the Prime Minister decided that he should retire within a year and that St. Laurent, who had recently threatened to leave Cabinet and return home to Quebec, should be the successor.[72] Howe was among those who persuaded St. Laurent not to resign. He also helped persuade St. Laurent to stand for the leadership, offering to remain in Cabinet to assist him.[73]"", 'On 20 January 1948, Mackenzie King announced his intent to resign and a Cabinet reshuffle; both St. Laurent[74] and Howe convinced the Prime Minister to move Howe, who had not enjoyed his work at the Ministry of Reconstruction and Supply, to become Minister of Trade and Commerce.[75] Howe publicly announced that he was ""not available"" to stand for the leadership and that he was supporting St. Laurent. The Quebecer was elected Leader of the Liberal Party in August, and Mackenzie King resigned on 15 November.[76]', 'In March 1955, St. Laurent tabled legislation to make the Department of Defence Production permanent and extend the extraordinary powers of the Minister.[92] Fearful of another damaging confrontation between Howe and the Opposition, the Cabinet agreed that St. Laurent would guide the bill through, but after the first day of debate St. Laurent, who was prone to depression, absented himself.[93] Tory frontbencher Donald Fleming contended that the extension could make the minister ""the virtual dictator of the economy"".[92] With St. Laurent absent (or when present, silent), Howe took charge of the bill, and according to his biographers, Robert Bothwell and William Kilbourn, ""utterly failed to perceive that the bill and his manner of defending it were a godsend to the opposition"".[94] When Howe alluded to the Avro Arrow project and that he ""was out on a limb for $30 million"", which gave him ""the shudders"", the Opposition met the statement with jeers and cries of ""What\'s a million?""[95] In early July, Howe left town for a long weekend, after asking St. Laurent and Minister of Finance Walter Harris to maintain his stand while he was gone, although he gave Harris the authority to do as he saw fit. Without informing Howe, St. Laurent contacted Drew, and the two men agreed that the minister\'s powers would expire in 1959 unless sooner renewed. The amended bill passed the Commons in Howe\'s absence, and when he returned, he furiously accused Harris of making a deal behind his back. However, when Howe was told that it had been the Prime Minister\'s decision, he accepted it.[96] Howe had earlier turned down an Opposition offer to agree to a three-year extension of his ministerial powers, saying ""That would mean coming back to Parliament in three years, and I\'ve more to do with my time than amusing Parliament.""[97] The extension was allowed to expire in 1959, although by then, Howe had left office.[97]', 'Howe returned to Ottawa after his defeat, cleared his office, and soon sold his house there, moving to Montreal.[123] After St. Laurent announced his retirement in September, Howe wrote to the former Prime Minister, ""The young men of the party must take on the job of reorganising and rebuilding, and perhaps the sooner they get at it the better.""[124] While publicly taking no position, Howe privately supported former External Affairs Minister Pearson for the Liberal leadership, and Pearson won the contest in January 1958. Howe advised Pearson not to take any action that might provoke an election. Pearson did not heed Howe and challenged Diefenbaker as soon as Parliament met. The election on 31 March returned the Progressive Conservatives in a record landslide, which left the Liberals with 48\xa0seats. Howe, who took no part in the campaign, had already left for Europe with his wife, Alice, on an extended holiday.[125] On his return, he did what he could to help rebuild the Liberal Party after the disaster, assisting with fundraising and seeking to unite factions within the party.[126]', 'Prime Minister Diefenbaker said after Howe died, ""We often had strong differences but our personal relations remained most friendly at all times\xa0... He gave his great ability, indomitable courage and energy to his country in a manner that has earned for him and will assure him of a large place in the history of Canada\'s war effort.""[130] Opposition Leader Pearson stated, ""He was a man who shirked no duty, faltered in no task, was daunted by no obstacle. He got things done, and they were good things for the country he served so well and so long.""[130] At his memorial service, enemies and friend alike gathered. Among the eulogies delivered by friends and colleagues at Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal, it was remarked that Howe often stated proudly that he was ""an American by birth but Canadian by choice"".[131]']"

He lacked a classical education but read voraciously and was well versed in modern languages, and started publishing translations from French and English at an early age.

In the early 1780s, Huber became friends with the jurist Christian Gottfried Körner, his fiancée Minna Stock, and her older sister Dora Stock, whom he later promised to marry. Together, the friends wrote in admiration to the poet Friedrich Schiller and successfully invited him to come to Leipzig.

Ismay ""was overjoyed at the prospect of serving under Churchill again"" and accepted the post immediately.[175] Although not a politician, Ismay was well-suited for the position because of his close relationships with the leaders of the commonwealth countries, largely the result of his work during the war.[176]']"

Before his presidency, he gained fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Often praised as an advocate for ordinary Americans and for his work in preserving the union of states, Jackson has also been criticized for his racial policies, particularly his treatment of Native Americans.', 'Jackson ran again in 1828, defeating Adams in a landslide. In 1830, he signed the Indian Removal Act. This act, which has been described as ethnic cleansing, displaced tens of thousands of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands east of the Mississippi and resulted in thousands of deaths. Jackson faced a challenge to the integrity of the federal union when South Carolina threatened to nullify a high protective tariff set by the federal government. He threatened the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but the crisis was defused when it was amended. In 1832, he vetoed a bill by Congress to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States, arguing that it was a corrupt institution. After a lengthy struggle, the Bank was dismantled. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to pay off the national debt. He survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president. In one of his final presidential acts, he recognized the Republic of Texas.', 'Like most planters in the Southern United States, Jackson used slave labor. In 1804, Jackson had nine African-American slaves; by 1820, he had over 100; and by his death in 1845, he had over 150.[55] Over his lifetime, he owned a total of 300 slaves.[56] Jackson subscribed to the paternalistic idea of slavery, which claimed that slave ownership was morally acceptable as long as slaves were treated with humanity and their basic needs were cared for.[57] In practice, slaves were treated as a form of wealth whose productivity needed to be protected.[58] Jackson directed harsh punishment for slaves who disobeyed or ran away.[59] For example, in an 1804 advertisement to recover a runaway slave, he offered ""ten dollars extra, for every hundred lashes any person will give him"" up to three hundred lashes—a number that would likely have been deadly.[59][60] Jackson also participated in the local slave trade.[61] Over time, his accumulation of wealth in both slaves and land placed him among the elite families of Tennessee.[62]', 'Later that year, Jackson became involved in former vice president Aaron Burr\'s plan to conquer Spanish Florida and drive the Spanish from Texas. Burr, who was touring what was then the Western United States after mortally wounding Alexander Hamilton in a duel, stayed with the Jacksons at the Hermitage in 1805.[65] He eventually persuaded Jackson to join his adventure. In October 1806, Jackson wrote James Winchester that the United States ""can conquer not only [Florida], but all Spanish North America"".[66] He informed the Tennessee militia that it should be ready to march at a moment\'s notice ""when the government and constituted authority of our country require it"",[67] and agreed to provide boats and provisions for the expedition.[65] Jackson sent a letter to President Thomas Jefferson telling him that Tennessee was ready to defend the nation\'s honor.[68]', ""Jackson also expressed uncertainty about the enterprise. He warned the Governor of Louisiana William Claiborne and Tennessee Senator Daniel Smith that some of the people involved in the adventure might be intending to break away from the United States.[69] In December, Jefferson ordered Burr to be arrested for treason.[65] Jackson, safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail, organized the militia to capture the conspirators.[70] He testified before a grand jury in 1807, implying that it was Burr's associate James Wilkinson who was guilty of treason, not Burr. Burr was acquitted of the charges.[71]"", 'On June 18, 1812, the United States declared war on the United Kingdom, launching the War of 1812.[72] Though the war was primarily caused by maritime issues,[73] it provided white American settlers on the southern frontier the opportunity to overcome Native American resistance to settlement, undermine British support of the Native American tribes,[74] and pry Florida from the Spanish Empire.[75]', 'Jackson immediately offered to raise volunteers for the war, but he was not called to duty until after the United States military was repeatedly defeated in the American Northwest. After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers,[76] who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack.[77][78][79][80] When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed,[81] and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband.[82] Jackson refused to disband his troops; instead, he led them on the difficult march back to Nashville, earning the nickname ""Hickory"" (later ""Old Hickory"") for his toughness.[83]', 'Jackson had not fully recovered from his wounds when Governor Willie Blount called out the militia in September 1813 following the August Fort Mims Massacre.[85] The Red Sticks, a confederate faction that had allied with Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief who was fighting with the British against the United States, killed about 250 militia men and civilians at Fort Mims in retaliation for an ambush by American militia at Burnt Corn Creek.[86]', ""On June 8, Jackson was appointed a brigadier general in the United States Army, and 10 days later was made a brevet major general with command of the Seventh Military District, which included Tennessee, Louisiana, the Mississippi Territory, and the Muscogee Creek Confederacy.[101] With President James Madison's approval, Jackson imposed the Treaty of Fort Jackson. The treaty required all Creek, including those who had remained allies, to surrender 23,000,000 acres (9,300,000\xa0ha) of land to the United States.[102]"", ""Jackson's victory made him a national hero,[125] and on February 27, 1815, he was given the Thanks of Congress and awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.[126] Though the Treaty of Ghent had been signed in December 1814 before the Battle of New Orleans was fought,[127] Jackson's victory assured that the United States control of the region between Mobile and New Orleans would not be effectively contested by European powers. This control allowed the American government to ignore one of the articles in the treaty, which would have returned the Creek lands taken in the Treaty of Fort Jackson.[128]"", ""Following the war, Jackson remained in command of troops in the southern half of the United States and was permitted to make his headquarters at the Hermitage.[129] Jackson continued to displace the Native Americans in areas under his command. Despite resistance from Secretary of the Treasury William Crawford, he signed five treaties between 1816 and 1820 in which the Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded tens of millions of acres of land to the United States. These included the Treaty of Tuscaloosa and the Treaty of Doak's Stand.[130][131]"", 'White American settlers were in constant conflict with Native American people collectively known as the Seminoles, who straddled the border between the U.S. and Florida.[136] In December 1817, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun initiated the First Seminole War by ordering Jackson to lead a campaign ""with full power to conduct the war as he may think best"".[137] Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida from Spain once and for all. Before departing, Jackson wrote to President James Monroe, ""Let it be signified to me through any channel\xa0... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished.""[138]', ""Jackson invaded Florida, captured the Spanish fort of St. Marks, and occupied Pensacola. Seminole and Spanish resistance was effectively ended by May 1818. He also captured two British subjects, Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot, who had been working with the Seminoles. After a brief trial, Jackson executed both of them, causing an international incident with the British. Jackson's actions polarized Monroe's cabinet. The occupied territories were returned to Spain.[139] Calhoun wanted him censured for violating the Constitution, since the United States had not declared war on Spain. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams defended him as he thought Jackson's occupation of Pensacola would lead Spain to sell Florida, which Spain did in the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819.[140] In February 1819, a congressional investigation exonerated Jackson,[141] and his victory was instrumental in convincing the Seminoles to sign the Treaty of Moultrie Creek in 1823, which surrendered much of their land in Florida.[142]"", ""The Panic of 1819, the United States' first prolonged financial depression, caused Congress to reduce the military's size and abolish Jackson's generalship.[144] In compensation, Monroe made him the first territorial governor of Florida in 1821.[145] He served as the governor for two months, returning to the Hermitage in ill health.[146] During his convalescence, Jackson, who had been a Freemason since at least 1798, became the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Tennessee for 1822–1823.[147] Around this time, he also completed negotiations for Tennessee to purchase Chickasaw lands. This became known as the Jackson Purchase. Jackson, Overton, and another colleague had speculated in some of the land and used their portion to form the town of Memphis.[148]"", ""Jackson used the power of the federal government to enforce the separation of Indigenous tribes and whites.[225] In May 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which Congress had narrowly passed.[226] It gave the president the right to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the eastern part of the United States in exchange for lands set aside for Native Americans west of the Mississippi,[227] as well as broad discretion on how to use the federal funds allocated to the negotiations.[228] The law was supposed to be a voluntary relocation program, but it was not implemented as one. Jackson's administration often achieved agreement to relocate through bribes, fraud and intimidation,[229] and the leaders who signed the treaties often did not represent the entire tribe.[230] The relocations could be a source of misery too: the Choctaw relocation was rife with corruption, theft, and mismanagement that brought great suffering to that people.[231]"", ""During his administration, he made about 70 treaties with American Indian tribes. He had removed almost all the Native Americans east of the Mississippi and south of Lake Michigan, about 70,000 people, from the United States;[239] though it was done at the cost of thousands of Native American lives lost because of the unsanitary conditions and epidemics arising from their dislocation, as well as their resistance to expulsion.[240] Jackson's implementation of the Indian Removal Act contributed to his popularity with his constituency. He added over 170,000 square miles of land to the public domain, which primarily benefited the United States' agricultural interests. The act also benefited small farmers, as Jackson allowed them to purchase moderate plots at low prices and offered squatters on land formerly belonging to Native Americans the option to purchase it before it was offered for sale to others.[241]"", 'As a compromise, Jackson supported the Tariff of 1832, which reduced the duties from the Tariff of 1828 by almost half. The bill was signed on July 9, but failed to satisfy extremists on either side.[251] On November 24, South Carolina had passed the Ordinance of Nullification,[252] declaring both tariffs null and void and threatening to secede from the United States if the federal government tried to use force to collect the duties.[253][254] In response, Jackson sent warships to Charleston harbor, and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession.[255] On December 10, he issued a proclamation against the ""nullifiers"",[256] condemning nullification as contrary to the Constitution\'s letter and spirit, rejecting the right of secession, and declaring that South Carolina stood on ""the brink of insurrection and treason"".[257] On December 28, Calhoun, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate, resigned as vice president.[258]', 'A few weeks after his inauguration, Jackson started looking into how he could replace the Second Bank of the United States.[263] The Bank had been chartered by President Madison in 1816 to restore the United States economy after the War of 1812. Monroe had appointed Nicholas Biddle as the Bank\'s executive.[264] The Bank was a repository for the country\'s public monies which also serviced the national debt; it was formed as a for-profit entity that looked after the concerns of its shareholders.[265] In 1828, the country was prosperous [266] and the currency was stable,[267] but Jackson saw the Bank as a fourth branch of government run by an elite,[263] what he called the ""money power"" that sought to control the labor and earnings of the ""real people"", who depend on their own efforts to succeed: the planters, farmers, mechanics, and laborers.[268] Additionally, Jackson\'s own near bankruptcy in 1804 due to credit-fuelled land speculation had biased him against paper money and toward a policy favorable to hard money.[269]', ""Jackson was the first president to be subjected to both a physical assault and an assassination attempt.[311] On May 6, 1833, Robert B. Randolph struck Jackson in the face with his hand because Jackson had ordered Randolph's dismissal from the navy for embezzlement. Jackson declined to press charges.[312] While Jackson was leaving the United States Capitol on January 30, 1835, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at him, which misfired. Lawrence pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane until others intervened to restrain Lawrence, who was later found not guilty by reason of insanity and institutionalized.[313][314]"", 'Since the early 1820s, large numbers of Americans had been immigrating into Texas, a territory of the newly independent nation of Mexico.[331] As early as 1824, Jackson had supported acquiring the region for the United States.[332] In 1829, he attempted to purchase it, but Mexico did not want to sell. By 1830, there were twice as many settlers from the United States as from Mexico, leading to tensions with the Mexican government that started the Texas Revolution. During the conflict, Jackson covertly allowed the settlers to obtain weapons and money from the United States.[333] They defeated the Mexican military in April 1836 and declared the region an independent country, the Republic of Texas. The new Republic asked Jackson to recognize and annex it. Although Jackson wanted to do so, he was hesitant because he was unsure it could maintain independence from Mexico.[326] He also was concerned because Texas had legalized slavery, which was an issue that could divide the Democrats during the 1836 election. Jackson recognized the Republic of Texas on the last full day of his presidency, March 3, 1837.[334]', ""Jackson lobbied for the annexation of Texas. He was concerned that the British could use it as a base to threaten the United States[349] and insisted that it was part of the Louisiana Purchase.[350] Tyler signed a treaty of annexation in April 1844, but it became associated with the expansion of slavery and was not ratified. Van Buren, who had been Jackson's preferred candidate for the Democratic Party in the 1844 presidential election, had opposed annexation. Disappointed by Van Buren, Jackson convinced fellow Tennessean James K. Polk, who was then set to be Van Buren's running mate, to run as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee instead.  Polk defeated Van Buren for the nomination and won the general election against Jackson's old enemy, Henry Clay. Meanwhile, the Senate passed a bill to annex Texas, and it was signed on March 1, 1845.[351]""]"

Family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man.[13] Janet grew up with two sisters (Rebbie and La Toya) and six brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, Michael and Randy).[11] Another brother, Marlon\'s twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.[14] The Jacksons were devout Jehovah\'s Witnesses, although Janet would later refrain from organized religion.[15]', ""In 1977, She was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times.[8] She later starred in A New Kind of Family and later got a recurring role on Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six.[8] Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series, largely due to the emotional stress of her secret marriage to R&B singer James DeBarge. Jackson later elaborated on her time on the show in an interview with Anderson Cooper, revealing that the cast would occasionally play pranks on her, but she spoke fondly of them.[17][18]"", 'Control was declared ""remarkably nervy and mature"" for a teenage act, also considered ""an alternative to the sentimental balladry"" which permeated radio, likening Jackson to Donna Summer\'s position of ""unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it.""[31][32][33] The album spawned five top five singles, ""What Have You Done for Me Lately"", ""Nasty"", ""When I Think of You"", ""Control"", and ""Let\'s Wait Awhile"", and a top 15 hit with ""The Pleasure Principle"".

And so it follows of necessity that kings were the authors and makers of the laws, and not the laws of the kings.""[73]', 'A dissident Catholic, Guy Fawkes, was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings on the night of 4–5 November 1605, the eve of the state opening of the second session of James\'s first English Parliament.

The Earl of Salisbury exploited this to extract higher subsidies from the ensuing Parliament than any but one granted to Elizabeth.[103] Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed.[104]', 'In early 1625, James was plagued by severe attacks of arthritis, gout, and fainting fits, and fell seriously ill in March with tertian ague and then suffered a stroke. He died at Theobalds House in Hertfordshire on 27 March during a violent attack of dysentery, with Buckingham at his bedside.[q] James\'s funeral on 7 May was a magnificent but disorderly affair.[176] Bishop John Williams of Lincoln preached the sermon, observing, ""King Solomon died in Peace, when he had lived about sixty years ... and so you know did King James"".

Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy."", 'Jinnah was also a supporter of working class causes and an active trade unionist.[43] He was elected President of All India Postal Staff Union in 1925 whose membership was 70,000.[43] According to All Pakistan Labour Federation\'s publication Productive Role of Trade Unions and Industrial Relations, being a member of Legislative Assembly, Jinnah pleaded forcefully for rights of workers and struggled for getting a ""living wage and fair conditions"" for them.[44] He also played an important role in enactment of Trade Union Act of 1926 which gave trade union movement legal cover to organise themselves.[44]', ""Relations between Indians and British were strained in 1919 when the Imperial Legislative Council extended emergency wartime restrictions on civil liberties; Jinnah resigned from it when it did. There was unrest across India, which worsened after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, in which British Indian Army troops fired upon a protest meeting, killing hundreds. In the wake of Amritsar, Gandhi, who had returned to India and become a widely respected leader and highly influential in the Congress, called for satyagraha against the British. Gandhi's proposal gained broad Hindu support, and was also attractive to many Muslims of the Khilafat faction. These Muslims, supported by Gandhi, sought retention of the Ottoman caliphate, which supplied spiritual leadership to many Muslims.  The caliph was the Ottoman Emperor, who would be deprived of both offices following his nation's defeat in the First World War. Gandhi had achieved considerable popularity among Muslims because of his work during the war on behalf of killed or imprisoned Muslims.[62][63][64] Unlike Jinnah and other leaders of the Congress, Gandhi did not wear western-style clothing, did his best to use an Indian language instead of English, and was deeply rooted in Indian culture. Gandhi's local style of leadership gained great popularity with the Indian people. Jinnah criticised Gandhi's Khilafat advocacy, which he saw as an endorsement of religious zealotry.[65] Jinnah regarded Gandhi's proposed satyagraha campaign as political anarchy, and believed that self-government should be secured through constitutional means. He opposed Gandhi, but the tide of Indian opinion was against him.  At the 1920 session of the Congress in Nagpur, Jinnah was shouted down by the delegates, who passed Gandhi's proposal, pledging satyagraha until India was independent. Jinnah did not attend the subsequent League meeting, held in the same city, which passed a similar resolution. Because of the action of the Congress in endorsing Gandhi's campaign, Jinnah resigned from it, leaving all positions except in the Muslim League.[66][67]"", 'In 1927, the British Government, under Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, undertook a decennial review of Indian policy mandated by the Government of India Act 1919.  The review began two years early as Baldwin feared he would lose the next election (which he did, in 1929). The Cabinet was influenced by minister Winston Churchill, who strongly opposed self-government for India, and members hoped that by having the commission appointed early, the policies for India which they favoured would survive their government. The resulting commission, led by Liberal MP John Simon, though with a majority of Conservatives, arrived in India in March 1928.[69] They were met with a boycott by India\'s leaders, Muslim and Hindu alike, angered at the British refusal to include their representatives on the commission.  A minority of Muslims, though, withdrew from the League, choosing to welcome the Simon Commission and repudiating Jinnah.  Most members of the League\'s executive council remained loyal to Jinnah, attending the League meeting in December 1927 and January 1928 which confirmed him as the League\'s permanent president. At that session, Jinnah told the delegates that ""A constitutional war has been declared on Great Britain. Negotiations for a settlement are not to come from our side\xa0... By appointing an exclusively white Commission, [Secretary of State for India] Lord Birkenhead has declared our unfitness for self-government.""[70]', 'On 3 September 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain announced the commencement of war with Nazi Germany.[115] The following day, the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, without consulting Indian political leaders, announced that India had entered the war along with Britain. There were widespread protests in India. After meeting with Jinnah and with Gandhi, Linlithgow announced that negotiations on self-government were suspended for the duration of the war.[116] The Congress on 14 September demanded immediate independence with a constituent assembly to decide a constitution; when this was refused, its eight provincial governments resigned on 10 November and governors in those provinces thereafter ruled by decree for the remainder of the war.  Jinnah, on the other hand, was more willing to accommodate the British, and they in turn increasingly recognised him and the League as the representatives of India\'s Muslims.[117] Jinnah later stated, ""after the war began,\xa0... I was treated on the same basis as Mr Gandhi. I was wonderstruck why I was promoted and given a place side by side with Mr Gandhi.""[118] Although the League did not actively support the British war effort, neither did they try to obstruct it.[119]', 'On 4 July 1947, Liaquat asked Mountbatten on Jinnah\'s behalf to recommend to the British king, George VI, that Jinnah be appointed Pakistan\'s first governor-general. This request angered Mountbatten, who had hoped to have that position in both dominions—he would be India\'s first post-independence governor-general—but Jinnah felt that Mountbatten would be likely to favour the new Hindu-majority state because of his closeness to Nehru. In addition, the governor-general would initially be a powerful figure, and Jinnah did not trust anyone else to take that office. Although the Boundary Commission, led by British lawyer Sir Cyril Radcliffe, had not yet reported, there were already massive movements of populations between the nations-to-be, as well as sectarian violence.  Jinnah arranged to sell his house in Bombay and procured a new one in Karachi. On 7 August, Jinnah, with his sister and close staff, flew from Delhi to Karachi in Mountbatten\'s plane, and as the plane taxied, he was heard to murmur, ""That\'s the end of that.""[166][167][168]  On 11 August, he presided over the new constituent assembly for Pakistan at Karachi, and addressed them, ""You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan\xa0... You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State ... I think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State.""[169] On 14 August, Pakistan became independent; Jinnah led the celebrations in Karachi. One observer wrote, ""here indeed is Pakistan\'s King Emperor, Archbishop of Canterbury, Speaker and Prime Minister concentrated into one formidable Quaid-e-Azam.""[170]', 'The civil awards of Pakistan includes an \'Order of Quaid-i-Azam\'. The Jinnah Society also confers the \'Jinnah Award\' annually to a person that renders outstanding and meritorious services to Pakistan and its people.[221] Jinnah is depicted on all Pakistani rupee currency, and is the namesake of many Pakistani public institutions. The former Quaid-i-Azam International Airport in Karachi, now called the Jinnah International Airport, is Pakistan\'s busiest. One of the largest streets in the Turkish capital Ankara, Cinnah Caddesi, is named after him, as is the Mohammad Ali Jenah Expressway in Tehran, Iran. In Chicago, a portion of Devon Avenue was named ""Mohammed Ali Jinnah Way"". A section of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn, New York was also named \'Muhammad Ali Jinnah Way\' in honour of the founder of Pakistan.[222] The Mazar-e-Quaid, Jinnah\'s mausoleum, is among Karachi\'s notable landmarks.[223] The ""Jinnah Tower"" in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India, was built to commemorate Jinnah.[224] The royalist government of Iran also released a stamp commemorating the centennial of Jinnah\'s birth in 1976. The Jinnah Mansion in Malabar Hill, Bombay, is in the possession of the Government of India, but the issue of its ownership has been disputed by the Government of Pakistan.[225] Jinnah had personally requested Prime Minister Nehru to preserve the house, hoping one day he could return to Bombay. There are proposals for the house to be offered to the government of Pakistan to establish a consulate in the city as a goodwill gesture, but Dina Wadia had also staked a claim on the property.[225][226]']"

After enrolling at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute and auditioning for commercials, Johansson soon lost interest, stating ""I didn\'t want to promote Wonder Bread.""[19] She shifted her focus to film and theater,[20] making her first stage appearance with two lines in the off-Broadway play Sophistry with Ethan Hawke.[21][20] Around this time, Johansson began studying at the Professional Children\'s School, a private educational institution for aspiring child actors in Manhattan.[16]', ""With David Arquette, Johansson appeared in the horror comedy Eight Legged Freaks (2002) about a collection of spiders exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow gigantic and begin killing animals and people.[37] After graduating from Professional Children's School that year, she applied to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, but was rejected, and decided to focus on her film career.[38]"", 'In Peter Webber\'s Girl with a Pearl Earring, which is based on the novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, Johansson played Griet, a young 17th-century servant in the household of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer (played by Colin Firth).

Johansson felt that her work playing the role was then complete.[179] She saw this as an opportunity to show her character\'s ability to be on her own and make choices for herself while facing difficult times and noted that her vulnerability distinguished her from other Avengers.[180] Critics were generally favorable in their reviews of the film, mainly praising Johansson and Pugh\'s performances.[181] The Hollywood Reporter\'s David Rooney thought the film was ""a stellar vehicle"" for Johansson,[182] and Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood found her ""again a great presence in the role, showing expert action and acting chops throughout"".[183] For the film, Johansson won The Female Movie Star of 2021 at the 47th People\'s Choice Awards.[184] Also that year, she reprised her voice role as Ash in the sequel Sing 2.[185]', ""While attending the Professional Children's School, Johansson dated classmate Jack Antonoff from 2001 to 2002.[247] She dated her Black Dahlia co-star Josh Hartnett for about two years until the end of 2006.

Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time.[9] The future of the empire upon Henry's eventual death was not secure: although the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England.[10] Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death.[11] To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the king of France of the rival line of the House of Capet. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.[12]"", 'John inherited a sophisticated system of administration in England, with a range of royal agents answering to the Royal Household: the Chancery kept written records and communications; the Treasury and the Exchequer dealt with income and expenditure respectively; and various judges were deployed to deliver justice around the kingdom.[84] Thanks to the efforts of men like Hubert Walter, this trend towards improved record keeping continued into his reign.[85] Like previous kings, John managed a peripatetic court that travelled around the kingdom, dealing with both local and national matters as he went.[86] John was very active in the administration of England and was involved in every aspect of government.[87] In part he was following in the tradition of Henry I and Henry II, but by the 13th century the volume of administrative work had greatly increased, which put much more pressure on a king who wished to rule in this style.[87] John was in England for much longer periods than his predecessors, which made his rule more personal than that of previous kings, particularly in previously ignored areas such as the north.[88]', 'Popular representations of John first began to emerge during the Tudor period, mirroring the revisionist histories of the time.[242] The anonymous play The Troublesome Reign of King John portrayed the King as a ""proto-Protestant martyr"", similar to that shown in John Bale\'s morality play Kynge Johan, in which John attempts to save England from the ""evil agents of the Roman Church"".[257] By contrast, Shakespeare\'s King John, a relatively anti-Catholic play that draws on The Troublesome Reign for its source material, offers a more ""balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome\'s machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler"".[258]']"

Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency.[b] Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, he went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to break Republican opposition.[5] As the conflict grew between the branches of government, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. He persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, but ended up being impeached by the House of Representatives and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate.

He was of English, Scots-Irish, and Irish ancestry.[6] He had a brother William, four years his senior, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. Johnson\'s birth in a two-room shack was a political asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins.[7][8] Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. Jacob Johnson had been a porter for the State Bank of North Carolina, appointed by William Polk, a relative of President James K. Polk.[9] Both Jacob and Mary were illiterate, and had worked as tavern servants, while Johnson never attended school[8] and grew up in poverty.[8] Jacob died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three.[10] Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was then looked down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. Since Andrew did not resemble either of his siblings, there are rumors that he may have been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried to a man named Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.[11]', 'In his first term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not consistently vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and fellow Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system in a state of flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for reelection in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County.[1][2] Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.[33]', 'In 1840, Johnson was selected as a presidential elector for Tennessee, giving him more statewide publicity. Although Democratic President Martin Van Buren was defeated by former Ohio senator William Henry Harrison, Johnson was instrumental in keeping Greene County in the Democratic column.[34] He was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1841, where he served a two-year term.[35] He had achieved financial success in his tailoring business, but sold it to concentrate on politics. He had also acquired additional real estate, including a larger home and a farm (where his mother and stepfather took residence), and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves.[36]', 'Having served in both houses of the state legislature, Johnson saw election to Congress as the next step in his political career. He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support, including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville, and defeated Jonesborough lawyer John A. Aiken by 5,495 votes to 4,892.[37][38] In Washington, he joined a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor, maintained an anti-abolitionist stance, argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs.[39] With Eliza remaining in Greeneville, Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the Library of Congress.[40] Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat, James K. Polk, was elected president in 1844, and Johnson had campaigned for him, the two men had difficult relations, and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions.[41]', ""In the presidential election of 1848, the Democrats split over the slavery issue, and abolitionists formed the Free Soil Party, with former president Van Buren as their nominee. Johnson supported the Democratic candidate, former Michigan senator Lewis Cass. With the party split, Whig nominee General Zachary Taylor was easily victorious, and carried Tennessee.[46] Johnson's relations with Polk remained poor; the President recorded of his final New Year's reception in 1849 that"", ""The new senator took his seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C. Jones, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without his wife and family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson immediately set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the Homestead Bill were more likely to be Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22.[75][76] In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners.[77] Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it."", ""The new senator took his seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C.

The convention deadlocked, with no candidate able to gain the required two-thirds vote, but the sides were too far apart to consider Johnson as a compromise. The party split, with Northerners backing Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas while Southerners, including Johnson, supported Vice President Breckinridge for president. With former Tennessee senator John Bell running a fourth-party candidacy and further dividing the vote, the Republican Party elected its first president, former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln.

The shooting of the President was part of a conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Johnson, and Seward the same night. Seward barely survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin, George Atzerodt, got drunk instead of killing the vice president. Leonard J. Farwell, a fellow boarder at the Kirkwood House, awoke Johnson with news of Lincoln\'s shooting. Johnson rushed to the President\'s deathbed, where he remained a short time, on his return promising, ""They shall suffer for this. They shall suffer for this.""[116] Lincoln died at 7:22\xa0am the next morning; Johnson\'s swearing-in occurred between 10 and 11\xa0am with Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase presiding in the presence of most of the Cabinet. Johnson\'s demeanor was described by the newspapers as ""solemn and dignified"".[117] Some Cabinet members had last seen Johnson, apparently drunk, at the inauguration.[118] At noon, Johnson conducted his first Cabinet meeting in the Treasury Secretary\'s office, and asked all members to remain in their positions.[119]', ""Johnson presided with dignity over Lincoln's funeral ceremonies in Washington, before his predecessor's body was sent home to Springfield, Illinois, for interment.[121] Shortly after Lincoln's death, Union General William T. Sherman reported he had, without consulting Washington, reached an armistice agreement with Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston for the surrender of Confederate forces in North Carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power, with private property rights (slaves) to be respected. This did not even grant freedom to those in slavery. This was not acceptable to Johnson or the Cabinet, who sent word for Sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals, which he did. Further, Johnson placed a $100,000 bounty (equivalent to $1.99\xa0million in 2023) on Confederate President Davis, then a fugitive, which gave Johnson the reputation of a man who would be tough on the South. More controversially, he permitted the execution of Mary Surratt for her part in Lincoln's assassination. Surratt was executed with three others, including Atzerodt, on July 7, 1865.[122]"", 'Upon taking office, Johnson faced the question of what to do with the former Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln pocket vetoed it.[123]', 'Johnson was initially left to devise a Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865.[126] Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.[127]', ""Johnson's first Reconstruction actions were two proclamations, with the unanimous backing of his Cabinet, on May 29. One recognized the Virginia government led by provisional Governor Francis Pierpont. The second provided amnesty for all ex-rebels except those holding property valued at $20,000 or more; it also appointed a temporary governor for North Carolina and authorized elections. Neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding black suffrage or freedmen's rights. The President ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states.[128]"", 'Congress was reluctant to confront the President, and initially only sought to fine-tune Johnson\'s policies towards the South.[133] According to Trefousse, ""If there was a time when Johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the Republican Party, it was the period following the return of Congress.""[134] The President was unhappy about the provocative actions of the Southern states, and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there, but made no statement publicly, believing that Southerners had a right to act as they did, even if it was unwise to do so. By late January 1866, he was convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans – both for the success of Reconstruction and for reelection in 1868. He would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise African Americans in the District of Columbia, a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all-white referendum. A bill to accomplish this passed the House of Representatives, but to Johnson\'s disappointment, stalled in the Senate before he could veto it.[135]', ""Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, leader of the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an understanding with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, to the delight of white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day.[135] Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated and that the moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates also wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.[136]"", ""Congress also proposed the Fourteenth Amendment to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed — by Congress, not the president.[144] Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition.[145] When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.[146]"", 'Efforts to compromise failed,[147] and a political war ensued between the united Republicans on one side, and on the other, Johnson and his Northern and Southern allies in the Democratic Party. He called a convention of the National Union Party. Republicans had returned to using their previous identifier; Johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term, in 1868.[148] The battleground was the election of 1866; Southern states were not allowed to vote. Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour, known as the ""Swing Around the Circle"". The trip, including speeches in Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis, and Columbus, proved politically disastrous, with the President making controversial comparisons between himself and Jesus, and engaging in arguments with hecklers. These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency. The Republicans won by a landslide, increasing their two-thirds majority in Congress, and made plans to control Reconstruction.[149] Johnson blamed the Democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the National Union movement.[150]', ""In January 1867, Congressman Stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under martial law. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion of the process of adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.[151]"", ""The new Congress met for a few weeks in March 1867, then adjourned, leaving the House Committee on the Judiciary behind, tasked in the first impeachment inquiry against Johnson with reporting back to the full House whether there were grounds for Johnson to be impeached. This committee duly met, examined the President's bank accounts, and summoned members of the Cabinet to testify. When a federal court released former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.[154]"", ""Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The President had Attorney General Henry Stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications. When Congress reconvened in July, it passed a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, waited for his veto, overrode it, and went home. In addition to clarifying the powers of the generals, the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South. With Congress in recess until November, Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders, General Philip Sheridan, who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support. Johnson was initially deterred by a strong objection from Grant, but on August 5, the President demanded Stanton's resignation; the secretary refused to quit with Congress out of session.[155] Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under the Tenure of Office Act; Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army.[156]"", ""Grant, under protest, followed Johnson's order transferring Sheridan and another of the district commanders, Daniel Sickles, who had angered Johnson by firmly following Congress's plan. The President also issued a proclamation pardoning most Confederates, exempting those who held office under the Confederacy, or who had served in federal office before the war but had breached their oaths. Although Republicans expressed anger with his actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic. No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling, but the Democrats took control of the Ohio General Assembly, allowing them to defeat for reelection one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator Benjamin Wade. Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote.[157]"", 'The adverse results momentarily put a stop to Republican calls to impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections.[158] Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.[159]', ""Johnson notified Congress of Stanton's suspension and Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act. Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed Lorenzo Thomas to replace him. Stanton refused to leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act, by a vote of 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress.[160]"", ""The defense relied on the provision of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress.[162] Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.[163]"", ""Johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal; for example, he pledged to Iowa Senator James W. Grimes that he would not interfere with Congress's Reconstruction efforts. Grimes reported to a group of Moderates, many of whom voted for acquittal, that he believed the President would keep his word. Johnson also promised to install the respected John Schofield as War Secretary. [164] Kansas Senator Edmund G. Ross received assurances that the new, Radical-influenced constitutions ratified in South Carolina and Arkansas would be transmitted to the Congress without delay, an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal.[165]"", ""One reason senators were reluctant to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation.[166][167] Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.[168]"", 'With the dealmaking, Johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict, and in the days leading up to the ballot, newspapers reported that Stevens and his Radicals had given up. On May 16, the Senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment, accusing Johnson of firing Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office of Act once the Senate had overturned his suspension. Thirty-five senators voted ""guilty"" and 19 ""not guilty"", thus falling short by a single vote of the two-thirds majority required for conviction under the Constitution. Ten Republicans—Senators Grimes, Ross, Trumbull, James Dixon, James Rood Doolittle, Daniel Sheldon Norton, William Pitt Fessenden, Joseph S. Fowler, John B. Henderson, and Peter G. Van Winkle—voted to acquit the President. With Stevens bitterly disappointed at the result, the Senate then adjourned for the Republican National Convention; Grant was nominated for president. The Senate returned on May 26 and voted on the second and third articles, with identical 35–19 results. Faced with those results, Johnson\'s opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings.[169][170] [171] Stanton ""relinquished"" his office on May 26, and the Senate subsequently confirmed Schofield.[172] When Johnson renominated Stanbery to return to his position as attorney general after his service as a defense manager, the Senate refused to confirm him.[173]', ""Soon after taking office as president, Johnson reached an accord with Secretary of State William H. Seward that there would be no change in foreign policy. In practice, this meant that Seward would continue to run things as he had under Lincoln. Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860; the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869. At the time of Johnson's accession, the French had intervened in Mexico, sending troops there. While many politicians had indulged in saber rattling over the Mexican matter, Seward preferred quiet diplomacy, warning the French through diplomatic channels that their presence in Mexico was unacceptable. Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead. In April 1866, the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages, to conclude by November 1867.[175] On August 14, 1866, Johnson and his cabinet gave a reception for Queen Emma of Hawaii who was returning to Hawaii after her trip to Britain and Europe.[176][177][178]"", ""Seward was an expansionist, and sought opportunities to gain territory for the United States. After the loss of the Crimean War in the 1850s, the Russian government saw its North American colony (today Alaska) as a financial liability, and feared losing control to Britain whose troops would easily swoop in and annex the territory from neighboring Canada in any future conflict. Negotiations between Russia and the U.S. over the sale of Alaska were halted due to the outbreak of the Civil War, but after the U.S. victory in the war, talks resumed.[179] Russia instructed its minister in Washington, Baron Eduard de Stoeckl, to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections.[180] This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to $157\xa0million in present-day terms.[181] On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37–2.[182] Emboldened by his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited Wake Island in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. in 1898. He came close with the Danish West Indies as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.[183]"", ""Another treaty that fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, negotiated in settlement of the Alabama Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the United States Minister to Britain, former Maryland senator Reverdy Johnson, in late 1868, it was ignored by the Senate during the remainder of the President's term. The treaty was rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.[184][185]"", ""Johnson sought nomination by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. He remained very popular among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, just before the convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis and a few others still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.[192]"", 'The conflict with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six-year term and make the president and the Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as much as he could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.[193]', ""Seymour's operatives sought Johnson's support, but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, in part because of their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.[194]"", 'On March 3, the President hosted a large public reception at the White House on his final full day in office. Grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as Johnson, as was customary, and Johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all. Despite an effort by Seward to prompt a change of mind, he spent the morning of March 4 finishing last-minute business, and then shortly after noon rode from the White House to the home of a friend.[195][196]', 'Johnson\'s comeback garnered national attention, with the St. Louis Republican calling it ""the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of American politics can show"".[205] At his swearing-in in the Senate on March 5, 1875, he was greeted with flowers, and sworn in alongside Hamlin (his predecessor as vice president) by incumbent Vice President Henry Wilson (who as senator had voted for Johnson\'s ouster). Many Republicans ignored Senator Johnson, though some, such as Ohio\'s John Sherman (who had voted for conviction), shook his hand. Johnson remains the only former president to serve in the Senate. He spoke only once in the short session, on March 22 lambasting President Grant for his use of federal troops in support of Louisiana\'s Reconstruction government. The former president asked, ""How far off is military despotism?"" and concluded his speech, ""may God bless this people and God save the Constitution"".[206]', 'Johnson\'s comeback garnered national attention, with the St. Louis Republican calling it ""the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of American politics can show"".[205] At his swearing-in in the Senate on March 5, 1875, he was greeted with flowers, and sworn in alongside Hamlin (his predecessor as vice president) by incumbent Vice President Henry Wilson (who as senator had voted for Johnson\'s ouster).

In late July 1875, convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the Ohio gubernatorial race, he decided to travel there to give speeches. He began the trip on July 28, and broke the journey at his daughter Mary\'s farm near Elizabethton, where his daughter Martha was also staying. That evening he had a stroke, but refused medical treatment until the next day, when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from Elizabethton. He seemed to respond to their ministrations, but had another stroke on the evening of July 30, and died early the following morning at the age of 66. President Grant had the ""painful duty"" of announcing the death of the only surviving past president. Northern newspapers, in their obituaries, tended to focus on Johnson\'s loyalty during the war, while Southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president. Johnson\'s funeral was held on August 3 in Greeneville.[209][210] He was buried with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution placed under his head, according to his wishes. The burial ground was dedicated as the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in 1906, and with his home and tailor\'s shop, is part of the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site.[211]', 'Even as Rhodes and his school wrote, another group of historians (Dunning School) was setting out on the full rehabilitation of Johnson, using for the first time primary sources such as his papers, provided by his daughter Martha before her death in 1901, and the diaries of Johnson\'s Navy Secretary, Gideon Welles, first published in 1911. The resulting volumes, such as David Miller DeWitt\'s The Impeachment and Trial of President Andrew Johnson (1903), presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him. In James Schouler\'s 1913 History of the Reconstruction Period, the author accused Rhodes of being ""quite unfair to Johnson"", though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves. These works had an effect; although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency, they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct.[218]']"

He revived the struggling paper, sold it to a competitor and used the profits to obtain his journalism degree from the University of Kentucky in 1922.

The proceeds went to the United Negro College Fund, and Johnson held this event for twenty years, ending in 2005. ""A Midsummer Night\'s Magic"" eventually came under the umbrella of the Magic Johnson Foundation, which he founded in 1991.[123] The 1992 event, which was the first one held after Johnson\'s appearance in the 1992 Olympics, raised over $1.3 million for UNCF.

In addition to receiving a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award among other honors, Jolie was made an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George."", 'In 2004, Jolie appeared in four films. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[61] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone\'s Alexander, about Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[57] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander\'s bisexuality,[62] but it succeeded internationally, grossing $167.3 million.[50]', 'Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood\'s drama Changeling (2008).[72] Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[73] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and the Academy Award for Best Actress.[74][75][76][77] Jolie also voiced Tigress in the DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda film series.[78]', 'Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[125] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[124] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world.[20] In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[124]', 'On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[138] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[139] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[140] Since then, Jolie has been on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[130][141]', 'Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[129][152] She lobbied for humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that\'s the way to move the ball.""[129] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[153] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[154] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants\' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[152][155]', ""Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[156] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[156] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[157] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[158] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[159] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[160]"", ""Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[161] which opened in 2005,[162] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[163][164] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[165] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[145] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which treats and educates children who have HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[166][167]"", 'In September 2020, Jolie made a donation to two young boys who were running a lemonade stand in London to raise money for the people of Yemen, as the country was on the brink of humanitarian crisis caused by the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels.[185] In March 2022, a month into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Jolie visited Ukrainian children at the Vatican Children\'s Hospital Bambino Gesù. According to the clinic, Jolie commented, ""I am praying for an end to the war. This is the only way to end the suffering and the flight from the conflict zone. It\'s terrifying to see children paying the price in lost lives, compromised health and trauma.""[186] In May 2022, Jolie visited Lviv, Ukraine to meet with more displaced and hospitalized children.[187][188]', ""Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[191] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[192] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[193] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[194] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[195]"", 'Jolie\'s reputation started to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself.

On the outbreak of the Second World War the squadron was dispatched to France. Kain began flying operational sorties during the Phoney War and gained his first aerial victory, a German bomber, in November 1939. He claimed his fifth aerial victory in March 1940, becoming the RAF's first flying ace of the Second World War as well as its first recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross. His success early in the war and consequent media reports made him well known in Britain and the Dominions."", 'By early February 1940 the thaw was well underway, but this affected the runway of the aerodrome which was prone to bogging, impacting flight operations for the next few weeks. Kain was mentioned in dispatches on 20 February 1940 for his efforts pursuing the He 111 that he sighted late the previous month.[42][43] Weather conditions improved on 1 March 1940, and the following day Kain became involved in a dogfight with two Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters while in pursuit of some He 111s. He destroyed the first Bf 109 but the second damaged his engine with cannon fire before departing.[Note 2] Over the German lines when the attack took place, Kain glided 30 miles (48\xa0km) from 20,000 feet (6,100\xa0m) to reach French territory. When his damaged engine caught fire, Kain prepared to bail out but had to re-enter the cockpit when he realised his parachute strap was not in position. The flames went out and Kain glided on to a forced-landing at Metz.[36][44] His Hurricane was a wreck and he had to be flown back to Rouvres by a Bristol Blenheim in the evening. The encounter was reported by the BBC in its main radio bulletin later that day; Kain was not named and only referred to as a New Zealander.[45] A few days later, identified as Cobber, he completed a BBC Radio interview that was broadcast on 9 March 1940.[13] Reporters from the United States were not so restricted and his identity was becoming known in his home country.[30]', 'With the announcement of his DFC, the anonymity he had previously been afforded was no longer possible. There was significant public interest in Kain, his endeavours being widely reported in the United Kingdom and in the Dominions; one newspaper correspondent described Kain as ""carrying the Dominion banner across the German frontiers in grand style"".[50][53][54] Kain went on leave to England on 2 April, intending to spend time with Phillips.[55] Much to his irritation, the couple had to deal with intense media interest during his leave.[56] While in England, he and Phillips announced their engagement, and tentatively set a date in July for the wedding.[57][58]', ""By this time Kain was very fatigued.[85] Many of his fellow pilots had become casualties or been sent back to the United Kingdom, leaving him as one of the few still remaining of the squadron's original flying roster. Other pilots noted he was increasingly preoccupied and nervous. Although he flew patrols on 28 May, Kain saw little action and for the next two days he was grounded by No. 73 Squadron's commander.[86] He resumed flying on 31 May, leading a section in an uneventful mission providing cover for Fairey Battle bombers targeting German forces southeast of Reims. The first two days of June were quiet, but then the squadron received orders to move to Le Mans and operate from an advanced airfield at Échemines.[87] Kain led a flight of Hurricanes there early in the morning of 3 June; they then covered the move of the ground crew and administrative staff to Le Mans. He did not fly the next day[88] and flew a single patrol on 5 June, protecting the airfield. He sighted a Bf 109 and pursued it to near Reims, where he shot it down.[78][89]""]"

Featured opposite Shah Rukh Khan, Kapoor found herself challenged playing the complex personality of her character Kaurwaki with whom Ashoka falls in love.[22] Aśoka was screened at the Venice and 2001 Toronto International Film Festivals,[23] and received generally positive reviews internationally but failed to do well in India, which was attributed by critics to the way Ashoka was portrayed.[24] Jeff Vice of The Deseret News commended her compelling screen presence,[25] but Rediff.com believed that she was primarily used for aesthetic purposes.[26] At the 47th Filmfare Awards, Aśoka was nominated for five awards including a Best Actress nomination for Kapoor.[20]', 'A breakthrough in Kapoor\'s career came when she was cast by Karan Johar as Pooja (""Poo"", a good-natured, superficial girl) in the 2001 melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham....[27] She found little resemblance between herself and her ""over-the-top"" character, and modeled Poo\'s personality on that of Johar.[28] Filming the big-budget production, alongside an ensemble cast was a new experience for Kapoor, and she recalls it fondly as a dream come true.[29] Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... was an immensely popular release, finishing as India\'s second highest-grossing film of the year and Kapoor\'s highest-grossing film to that point.[30] It became one of the biggest Bollywood success of all time in the overseas market, earning over ₹1 billion (US$13\xa0million) worldwide.[31] Taran Adarsh described Kapoor as ""one of the main highlights of the film"",[32] and she received her second Filmfare nomination for the role—her first for Best Supporting Actress—as well as nominations at the International Indian Academy (IIFA) and Screen Awards.[20]', ""By 2004, Kapoor, who had confessed to having entered the film industry strictly for financial reasons,[37] was eager on broadening her range as an actor and thus decided to accept more challenging roles in addition to the archetypical glamorous lead.[35][38] Under the direction of Sudhir Mishra, Kapoor starred in Chameli as a golden-hearted prostitute who meets with a widowed investment banker (Rahul Bose). When Kapoor was first offered the part, she passed on it, explaining that she would be uncomfortable in the role.
